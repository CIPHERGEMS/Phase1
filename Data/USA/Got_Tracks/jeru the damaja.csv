Come Clean,The Sun Rises in the East,1993.0,"You wanna front—what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake-gangster emcees and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp' defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive, get live, catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroiliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a MAC
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x5)

Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten I'll tap your jaw?
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I G'd
'Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma‒
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique 'cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb, about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x9)

Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing crews, no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
'Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The TEC's technique 'cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot 'cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock, hmm...? But you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!

You Can’t Stop the Prophet,The Sun Rises in the East,1994.0,"Ohhh! Yo look towards the darkness
Nah nah yo, look towards the light
Yo what! Oh what the—? Yo, what is that?
It's a supernova
Nah nah man, that's a black hole
Yo! Yo!
Yo!
Yo it's... 
It's! It's!?

I leap over lies in a single bound (who are you?)
The Black Prophet
One day I got struck by Knowledge of Self
It gave me super-scientifical powers
Now I run through the ghetto
Battlin' my archnemesis Mr. Ignorance
He's been tryin' to take me out since the days of my youth
He feared this day would come
I'm hot on his trail, but sometimes he slips away
Because he has an army, they always give me trouble
Mainly - Hatred, Jealousy and Envy,
 
they attack me
They think they got me
But I use my super-science and I twist all three
I see sparks over that buildin' - they're shootin' at me
I dip, do a backflip
Then I hit 'em in the heart with sharp steel bookmarks
Ignorance hates when I drop it
But no matter what he do he can't stop the Prophet

Yo Prophet, yo Prophet, come here real quick
Yo, I just saw Ignorance downtown, let me put you on

Word, he down there buggin'
He got them illin' out, they shootin' and everything else

Let's continue the saga, mad mad drama
I met this chick, she said she knew where Ignorance was at
I said ""Where?""
She said, ""Downtown""
He had babies havin' babies - and young niggas sellin' crack
I think the bitch is lyin', it's a set up
I can smell it, but Ignorance is runnin' rampant
Aight baby show me the exact spot
Meet me at Hoyt and Schermerhorn at 3 on the dot
So I hops up on the A-Train, I'm bein' followed
My seventh sense senses danger
I turn around, it's Anger
And he brought a mob along, it's the same old song
Despair and Animosity got broke with the swiftness
I don't know what they think this is
I feel a sharp pain in my neck
Now I can't see, I'm like Hiram
They hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum
I tried to hold on but before long I dropped
When I awoke I was locked in the barber's shop
Trapped in the barber's chair
Oh no, they're gonna try and cut my hair
But that can't stop the Prophet

Yo Prophet!
Ignorance is tired of you followin' him around
We about to put an end to that right now
Animosity (yeah!), Despair (yo what's up?), get him!
Can't a damn thing stop me
Can't—can't a damn thing stop me
Can't—can't a damn thing—
Can't a damn thing stop me

A few minutes passed by, I hear a buzzin' noise
It was that chick with some of Ignorance's boys
She said, ""Prophet, we got you beat;
By the way I'm Mr. Ignorance's wife: Deceit
But enough talk; now for your hair cut""
When the clippers touched my hair, they blew the fuck up
After the explosion there was no one left
'Cause I know 
Dim Mak/poison hand
/touch of death
My vision's still kinda blurry, but I see a clue
Ignorance is at the library
I hurry with lightning speed like The Flash
He's at the big one on Grand Army Plaz'
When I get inside the doors shut and the lights go off
Damn, another trap
I hear a hissin' sound, I smell a funny smell
I gasp, I can't breathe
Ignorance is laughin' at me
Waitin' on my downfall, but he can't stop the Prophet

Well Prophet
It seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself
Oh, and what you did to my wife, it was nothing, I have others
Hahahahahaha... hahahahaha... hahahahaha... hahahahahah

Me or the Papes,Wrath of the Math,1997.0,"Party people, in the place to be
From the same man, who brought you Da Bichez
(Da Bichez, Da Bichez, Da Bichez)
We were misunderstood, last time we brought you
Da Bichez (Da Bichez Da Bichez)
Now we gonna clear it up and let you make up your own mind
Like this...

Now a queen's a queen, and a whore is a whore
She felt if she made me wait I'd have more respect for her
Adore her, eventually spendin up my digits
She felt that love would make me buy her mad material shit
She likes to trick em, cause ain't nothin like a sleepin victim
East New York style stick em -- ha ha ha, stick em
Top rated game, but if it's game I played it
Underestimated, swore the king was checkmated
She claims she loves my mind, cause I'm so intelligent
But fuck my mental, she was scheming on my mint
Evil inten-tion, to de-plenish the fund
She tried to jux me with the pussy cept for, the mask and gun
I was a fool to fall in lust with this evil ge-nius
She had me by the nuts
She ain't got shit but man she loves it plush
Whippin I whip, and suckin up I canibus
Back in the days, I woulda scraped her for this caper
But I realize, it wasn't me it was the paper

Let me kick it, about the digits, that I've collected
Long distance, and disconnected, it's gettin hectic
Before my record, they didn't show it
But now they throw it, hopin that they'll get drunk off Moet
Or Cristal, but that's not my par-ticular style and taste
My name ain't Puff and I ain't got loot to waste
I ain't got time to waste, bad bitches is all up in my face
Crazy ignorant, sweatin links minks and shit
Cosmetic, but deep down, derelict
Fake players, never get out the projects
It's pathetic -- the way she bends for dividends
I tried to jewel her but she tried to get a drink at the end
Of our con-vo-sation, I did not have the patience
Slid off to the next Asian
She said, ""What you do?"" I said, ""What?""
She said, ""You know your occuptation?""
So I broke the fuck out
In nineteen-ninety-six that's what it's all about
, but
I won't go that route
Back in the days Biz said it was The Vapors
But today, I realize that it's the papers
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""
(repeat 3X)

Now a whore's a whore, find a queen and she'll be my Earth
Respect love and protect her, for all that it's worth
I admit I have flaws, I flips it first, but deep down
I wishes to give em the universe
A lot of the ones that I thought was right wasn't
I build with Afu, he said ""Don't sweat it cause they come a dime a dozen""
Like my ex-stunt, wanted a diamond
Bitches love power, while queens, love refinement
Low stress environment, old age and retirement
Never have to wonder where my money went
Where my honey went, is her back gettin twisted
By the next fella
, always take heed to what I tell her
When I'm wrong, she lets me know I need correction
When I'm right she's my reflection
 
still we, use protection
Through thick and thin, thin and thick
She's my diamond in the rough not a whore or a trick
Great expectations, of me and she buildin nation
Everything we do and skyscrapin
Back in the days, the devil used to rape her
Nowadays, he got her chasin the paper
""Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I"" -- ""gets the paper""

Ya Playin’ Yaself,Wrath of the Math,1996.0,"Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

So all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
And all those skin tight jeans hon you're playin' yaself
And all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself
And all those hooker type wears baby you're playin' yaself
And all that big gun talk money you're playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-ya-playin-yaself-lyrics
99.9 Pa Cent,Heroz4Hire,1999,"You wanna front, what? Jump up and get bucked
The original, Dirty Rotten's fucking shit up
Empty your clip of lyrics in your chest and gut
All punks play the floor, it's raw and hardcore
Hotter than a meteor, scorching egos
Fake hoes, gangsters and super heroes
Cops pull me over like you under arrest
Some niggas I know act like bitches without breast
Dick riders, I hope you got your latex
Cause flesh gets burnt up during the process
DRS echoes through your projects
Met Billie Jean, had safe sex
Some MCs get caught up in the vortex
Mixing crack with cess, so they sold for fat checks
Listen to the words I manifest, the moment of truth have cats stressed
Every time you in the East they snatch the chain off your chest
Acting like you want some, but want none
Quick to make your finger like a gun, but faggots never bust none

99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit

99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick

Amateuristic martial arts is the number one cause of injury
Biters try to emulate my alchemy, get poisoned by the chemistry
99.9 percent of these niggas suck dick in the industry
Swords in my back, all for the benjies
I'm screaming off key, another body? No I'm back in 3D
Plus I can take the weight, I make the Earth rotate
Dick riders supply the gas, watch niggas head inflate
Wanting respect, but suspect hit the deck
This ain't just talk, Brooklyn East New York's on the set
Friendship vs. B.I. I keep my thoughts
Laser sharp jagged edges bust your third eye
Vessel of the most high, bullshit, they demand you supply
But don't get caught, the same nigga'll testify
Switch like a bitch
You not from East New York, you's a motherfucking snitch

99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit

Hip Hop Jim Kelly, leave the mic dead and smelly
Freak shows, flows and hoes back at the telly
Not your average nigga, gets more nasty than Dirk Diggler
I'm back like the night, swooping down on The Riddler
Fake thugs talk tough but ease off the trigger
So shook you shiver, poison verbs like alcohol destroy your liver
Make it volcanic hot, niggas got problems like Sir Smoke-a-Lot
Cannibals biting my dick, I need a tetanus shot
I'm the original, in cause your forgot
When it comes to war I get raw
Add another mic to the ones I rip, shooting the gift
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit

Ain’t the Devil Happy,The Sun Rises in the East,1994.0,"Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth. Nothing’s secret

As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless wisdom of the sages
Ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like Abel and Cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the Devil happy

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

I hate when the Devil's happy, so I wear my hair nappy
Knotty

won't go out like John Gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chilling, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What are we accomplishing? Nothing
What's the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The Devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another Queen without a King
What will our children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the Devil happy


Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range, I hope you hear this
And try to change this 'cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot? Who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all is the god we trust
The days blow by like dust,
even Men of Steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous, when only we can save us
Mentally enslave us for little or nothing, kill our neighbors
Animalistic, cannibalistic behavior
Look to the sky for your Savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers?
You must discover the power of self
Know thyself or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for

You can tell who's who by the things they want
Most chicks want minks
Diamonds, a Benz
Spend up all your ends
Prob'bly fuck your friends
High-post attitudes, real rude with fat asses
Think that the pussy is made out of gold
Try to control you by slidin' up and down on the wood
They be givin' up sex for goods
Dealin' with bitches is the same old song
They only want you 'til someone richer comes along
Don't get me wrong, strong black women
I know who's who so due respect I'm givin'
While queens stand by you, and stick around
Bitches suck you dry and push you down

I knew her style that's why I'm vegetarian
I told him she was out to get what she could get
He didn't believe me, so she bagged him up in the end
Made the pussy do tricks then she sucked his dick
He got caught up in the grip now he's payin' the rent
Black widow, she even killed dead presidents
That he'd owe. Shouldn't have got one red cent
I'd body slam her, but I'm not a misogynist
When I see a brother gettin' nabbed it makes me pissed
Cosmetic enchantress scandalous temptress
The way my man went out you'd think she was a pimpstress
Bitches come my way, I make 'em hop
Cause I'm hip to the game
I'm not a slave so I don't get pussy-whipped
Bear in mind you'll lose em' to end material riches

So your man got a Lex', you live in the projects
Tryin' a flex but you ain't the smartest
Your ass ain't the fattest, fuck around, play yourself and get dissed
I know your status, you can't touch my status
Deep down you want this
Dyin' a be famous but you can't attain this
Poppin' that coochie for Gucci
Bitches like you ain't shit to me

By the sound of my buzzer and a car or a truck
Screechin' off, so I jump up, scratch my nuts
But when I'm like ""Who's that?"" nobody speaks up
So I go to the door there's a note it says:
""We have Hip-Hop hostage with guns to his throat
Do the right thing and we might let him go
But if you call the police, that's all she wrote
You know what the motive is, it's all about dough
And in case ya think we bullshittin' here's the photo.""
I couldn't recognize the clowns because they was all hooded down
But I peeped Foxy Brown sippin' Cristal in the background
With fake alligator boots on
And smack dab in the middle was hip-hop with a Versace suit on
I immediately called Premo
I said ""Hip-Hop is in trouble,
 
meet me at my rest on the double
Don't even jump in the shower, 
matta'fact scratch my rest
Meet me and D&D in an half an hour
And bring all ya shit wit' you cuz you know what we got to do.""
Yo Afu! (Whassup?)
 
Lets jet-son like Elroy
If I recall correctly I last saw hip-hop down at Bad Boy
We'll see if 
Puff
 knows whassup
Cuz he's the one gettin' him drunk and fuckin' his mind up
We go to the office, he's nowhere to be found
So we snatch up Jay Black and beat his bitch ass down
""Now where's Hip-Hop?!"" ""Aaight, aaight..."" he confessed:
""Suge came and took him from Puff last night
He said he'd give him up if a real nigga came to retrieve 'em...""

Droppin' my rhyme science like I'm Imhotep
Application of mind over matter
Made fools scatter, rhymes fatter, minds splatter
Your girl bend over and over and over
Emcees try to touch the Damaja but you just can't win
Excellent with the word play, you lay
Face down, 
when my, mind spray
*Premier does his thing again like only Primo can*

Thunder on your Dome with no help from Mad Max
Lyrics like hype tattooes go over the dope tracks
We booby-traps, all our inventions
We know the intentions of MC
 kleptomaniacs
Rap brainiacs have cardiacs, soon after the attack
When it comes to rhymin', I slam harder than Shaq
Accomplish the bio-feedback, more complex than an almanac
Keep you up, like an aphrodisiac
Idealist, not an opportunist
Don't molest, no shorty still in all, I'm dangerous
Mentally you can't talk to me, hear me, or see me
You're not equipped
From, street blocks to cell blocks, my vo-cals rock
Do more work than a crackhead, with a toolbox
Jeru nerve touch-er, mic-ra-phone wrecker
If your honey's a Queen, I'll sex her
More important the mind strikes, like the nine strikes
A priest by May, you reach for your uz-ay, when my mind spray
*Primo flexes that razor sharp turntable wizardry*

J-E, Rrrah-U it's a horror to you
Lyrical kung-fu so do your kung-fu if you know kung-fu
Dirty, down low profile
Shoot up jams without the aid of lead projectiles
Style's ridiculous, techniques infamous
Take more heads than Santa Claus at Christmas
Science misfits, meet the wrath of my wit
Immediately following, they go into a conniption fit
Reach into my bag of darkness and spark this like an arsonist
Blow it up like a terrorist
I'm not a sexist 
don't have the power to be a racist
I'm a scientist, and an activist
Complex yet simple like 
Mixelplix
Unlike the silly devil, I don't come with tricks
So out there to all you MC's return to the righteous way
Or meet death face to face when my, mind spray
*Primo wrecks it like a 12 car collision*",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-my-mind-spray-lyrics

Pugilistic linguistics
Check out the mystics, we're fantistic (You mean fantastic)
Fuck it, you'll get your ass kicked
Challenge my verbal gymnastics (Vernacrobatics)

Stand, the mathematics are esoteric
Watch the style, but also peep the lyrics

Heracles, but now I stomp out emcees

Influential, scientifical power

Devour at a crazy rate

Throwing cerebral blows without my fist
Poisonous Taoist

Test the sound system, it throws off your equilibrium
Deep concentration can't fracture the meditation
Competition is flipped on at random
Deviant monks attack the mic,
 it's mental pandemonium
And then some, you go for your hand gun
Psychokinetic forces proceed to smash in your cerebellum
Phonetician with more stamina than a Christian

C3H5N3O9 like nitroglycerine
I bust as Afu-Ra crush, 
clash with us and meet Cerebus

Ready, ridiculous ravagery as I commence
I whirlwind through cities
Breaking down substances, combining matter
Test my hand skills and back bones splatter
Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like

The Frustrated Nigga,Wrath of the Math,1996.0,"Out of the fog into the smog, he walks in
He's ready for victory
He walks again by night, ruthlessly
Meeting wit the unknown

It's the educated field nigga, trained in guerilla
Warfare plus equipped wit mental hardware
Manifesting organizational skills
Cuz organizational skills kills more devils than bullets
Pull it, the psychological trigger and be a real nigga
Happy as a runaway slave in the jungle
The concrete jungle, here's your scars weary, here's your arms don't fear 'em
But you might die if you bail against the system
Another nigga caught up in the system
To amend my invisible chains and deviate from the system
No longer shall I be a victim
Victimized, circumsized by the lies of the system
It's equivalent to being nonexisent
I used to be a pawn in the game
Now I change my postion, I'm making moves
Beware of the frustrated nigga
Know what I'm saying

Ride the pale horse, triumphantly
Put a saddle on his back, take him to hell and back
You can take a nigga out the jungle
But you can't take the jungle out the cat
Black cats, brown cats, all types of cats
Mental fusion, it's no illusion, or delusion
Of grandeur but the way we were
And will be and ever shall be
Eternally but you mask my present existence
In ignorance, mock my appearance
Yet yearn for my essence, steal my lessons
So I reeducate, unlearn what
Was taught, hold down the fort
Each one teach one, now I got support
We don't need no water, let the muthafuka burn
Down to the ground
America, America, the beautiful
Thoughts from a frustrated nigga
You know what I'm saying

Systematic, destruction of the original man
Drugs by nigga on nigga
Cocaine, morphine, nicotine
The evil of men run through my bloodstream
And the blood of kings runs through my bloodstream
This dignified bastard
Hazardous to the health of America
Black rebel in your area
Psychoanalyze this
Then send your forces cuz now we mean business
You should now bear witness to a new breed of nigga
This nigga is smarter than the nigga of time's past
This nigga is the nigga of the future
This nigga will emancipate himself from the title of nigga
And restore his title as king

Jungle Music,The Sun Rises in the East,1994.0,"It started on the sands of land of the mother
Word to mother, king like my father
My style survived slave ships, whips, and chains, hardships
Still through all this, the praise roll off my lips
Bring your guns, chains and tongue force your religion
On me cut my hair, the vibes still exist
To destroy the molesters of my heritage
But they conceal the drums reveal, my royal lineage
King of kings, God of Gods
Like my ancestors drums I beat the odds
More mics killed than 
slaves during the middle passages
Who rapes and ravages and calls us savage?
Jungle bunny, I'm not mo' funny, I'm mo' deadly
They know one day we'll learn how to use it
That's why they fear our jungle music

""In the J-U-N-G-L-E""

We went from pyramids to the ghetto
Still my sounds make devils tumble like the walls of Jericho
Chant my power to devour all the snakes and rats
Extrasensory perception to avoid all traps
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord
In the sanctuary of your caves, white kids press record
As my mystic music spread from sea to galaxy
It's inevitable, you can't stop me
Try and carbon copy, but it always comes out sloppy
You can't outrap me, you can't outrock me
Like the dreads on my head, you try and lock me
Down underground, but I bounce to the jungle
Melodies that flows like the breeze
Through the trees,
 like my forefathers
Command the wind and seas - with my jungle music

""In the J-U-N-G-L-E""

Unga bunga binga
Sound warrior, I'll take your head more than a rap singer
Enlightener, with the mitre
Make the forces of my nature smite ya
Over the airwaves, powers are released
Holy music destroy the savage beast
I'll beat the devil like a Nyahbinghi drummer
Beats his drum,
 this beat will drum through the summer
Try to hold us back with all the strength you can muster
You'll hear a sound similar to the one Custer
Heard before he got ambushed,
 you'll get ambushed
For taking this back to Kush
For too long you've abused it
On the low used it - and called it jungle music

With a style similar to mine nowadays you know what I mean?
(For reals) Be tryin' to like...they infiltrated the camp
And now they they wanna take the style and claim it for they
Owns ya know? (That's how you feel?) But I'mma blow 'em up
Cause it's just like whatever you know what I'm saying? (Whatever)

It's too strategical and mathematical
I rotate so fast that I appear invisible
I keep it chemical, but never subliminal
The force centrifugal and spiritual
You got static? Get grounded, cause I've mastered electrical
Mostly mental, but don't sleep on the physical
Ignorance got' em chatterin', one even said I was a son to him
Still my LP is fatter than
His or yours, 
took a two-year pause
Now that I'm back on the set my foes drop like ho's drawers
In a brothel
, only dealin' with what's logical
Applied science left MC's penetrable
The leader's stroke is apocalyptic
Hostile like Arabics in Israel with automatics
And if you want it, the Monks can make it hectic
Set it off, fire burn up Jack Frost and Santa Claus
Whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

(Onyx Sample): ""And to all y'all crews...whatever""

Bound to blow up, but never disintegratin'
The ultimate MC equation
Ferromagnetic, ask my pops, it's genetic
That's why I'm a weedhead and not an alcoholic
Call it whatever you want to call it
Devils just know that it's some form of arithmetic
Hieroglyphic, cause you can picture this shit
The state of hip-hop today is like hookers in politics
Got MCin' locked down like a convict
Blowin' up opposition as I manoeuvre through it
And to make sure it's overstood
, I stick around
Popular like crime in ghetto neighbourhoods
Rock my crown like Shaka did, hold it down
Fuck your mind up like Joe Jackson, kids, check it out
So whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Lord Finesse: ""I gotta do my thing...I represent""
Onyx: ""And to all y'all crews, whatever""

Fire, flames, heat up the competition
Spontaneous combustion, like the Pope's religion
Your style of emceein' is Paganism
Your rhymes make no sense, just like a Roman Christian
But your niggas soup you up like Lipton
The Gwan Jang Nim of underground emceein' strikes again
The snake bites again, but I'm immune to the poisonous
Venom, ask the devil, he knows I'm dangerous
Freak on the mic, but not sexual
Call me unalike cause my rhymes are never homo
Make you sad, like when Cher left Sonny Bono
Fire burn Giuliani, Pataki and Cuomo
Whatever you want to do, make it clever
Whatever, whatever, whatever

The absolute bullshit

This bullshit is so bullshit I NEVER wanna hear this bullshit
On the radio
Or in my children's ears cause it's bullshit
You know? So as we talk about the bullshit
And what bullshit is
I'mma drop the bullshit on you right now
You know, the bullshit goes like this
Jump up in my Rolls Royce, top choice
Make em holler, everything I do is for a dollar
Fuck being civilized, I got dollar signs in my eyes
One day I'll fall, but for now I'll rise
Trust me, as the stink stuff, fries up
I'm cookin' up I used to spend the nights in spots run up
Buck buck but now I'm all growed up and blowed up
And believe me, baby paw, I got it all sewed up
And the loot is in big bags and all stored up
And the niggas I used to run with is all locked up
But, I'll keep bubblin', got em on the corners
Like court jesters jugglin', avoid the late night mugging
Because stick up kids be bugging
I paid my dues so I'm on some exotic island
Smilin', sun shinin' all off my diamonds
Sippin' on martinis bad hookers in bikinis
A air plane load of exotic work from Tahiti
Plus a squad of killer bitches that all carry Uzis
I got a lot so if it gets too hot
Jump in the billion dollar jet, or the million dollar yacht
Got the Teflon vest, in case they knock me out the box
Oh no, I think I hear gunshots
*rat-atat-atat-tat*
Huh huh ahh, huh, whew!
Damn, shit was just a dream, whew

There's a hole in the ozone layer
I'm rippin vampires
You think I give a fuck
Who's the biggest player
Or who's got the fattest bank roll
What is it if a man gains the world
And lose his own soul?
Bioengineered, mutated chickens
Niggas lickin' one another
Brother killin' brother
And you demon muthafuckas
Start coastal rivalries
The worlds greatest lust is jewelery
Mind Jah lick you with disease
So I inflict MC's like Ebola
Or some other man made cancer
Fuck a two-hundred dollar sweater
We need to try and reach the niggas
On the corner
But all we do is create drug dealers
Envy then creates murderers
Diamond rings, pretty hoes
Fat chains, expensive things
Just watch which way
Ya burner swings in this world of...


Chemical warfare
The telephoner acts like he lives here
The government is putting mad shit in the air
Projects are strategically set up
In the case that shit erupt
They easily blown up
Poisonous gases
The so-called righteous help for the masses
But it's them that judge their own asses
Knowing what their task is
But still receding, ass backwards
Do you need to ask me who the devil is
Some may call it showbizz
I just call 'em hypocrites
Cause they don't teach the children shit positive
Like how a man should live
They only focus on the negative
So they're stuck in the ghetto
While you drive a car and got a condo
It's all for the dough yo
It's killing your own people
Profits greater than (?Peneco?)
Forget about whats equal
In this world of...


Artificially inseminated
White bitches have babies most black youth are incarcerated
In the ghetto babies having babies but no loot
So most pregnancies are terminated
Warlocks keep the covenant
And the souls of the ignorant ones empower it
It's transparent
You see Uncle Sam as your parent
When America has beef you jump up to defend it
But you can still be a defendant
Ask my co-defendant
And we're both innocent
Every black man in America faces imprisonment
Ridicule, and torment
But in this tournament
The chosen few shall be triumphant
And the devil will be decapitated
So you can keep your duckets
And your dressing, I won't be emasculated

But a female is one of their strongest men
When I step to you don't seek refuge
Make it happen, fuck the rappin'
Because I know I got that sewed
The first time I ever touched the microphone it glowed
Now I explode, eruptin' like a nigga that drunk too much
But not intoxicated...
As mental stress increase you'll need to be sedated
Sick and tired of the izm schism
This time's a warning, after this we take it to pugilism
Mash out the beedies, dreads spark up the corn
I flow muddy like the gutter after the rainstorm
My mission to seek, build or destroy
Like Deadwood Dick, I be the Black Cowboy
And this is the showdown...

(I got the wild style...)
(Black Cowboy)

After this MC's will wish to do battle with me
For their sake I hope that they apply the proper strategy
In any case, worst comes to worst I'll be the best
Storms will come, this we know for sure, but can you stand the crash test?
There's no vest or no way you can get suited up
For what's about to happen, you might as well get zooted
I heard that ignorance is bliss, so I guess you're all blistered
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
And just in case the first time you missed it
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
Livin' on a diet of flesh and Mistic
I kicks the ballistics and keep it realistic
We shoot shit up like the Hatfields and McCoys
Perverted monks, the Black Cowboys

It's a cryin' shame what some niggas'll do for fame
When they think they know the game
But I switch up the rules of the game
Drops jewels in the game
The fluid is quite fatal, like water on the brain
I be the Sheriff and I got MC's on the chain gang
Continuous hard labour until the day that they hang
One outlaw tried to escape but I murdered his gang
Right back at ya bitch-ass just like a boomerang
Or a bolo, you couldn't knock me out with Apollo
The god is never chillin', hot like a volcano
Once I met up with this bandolero
Why'd he make me bust him in his head with his banjo?
I put MC's on the ceiling like Michelangelo
Did the Sistine Chapel
Known to kick and grapple, so you couldn't test the Real McCoy

Average Nigga,Wrath of the Math,1996.0,"I met this honey named Yolanda
You would not believe the things that I told her
She had potential so I thought that I would mould her
(Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Every time I think about it makes me woozy
And her rear end was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""
And I said
I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga
I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
No, no I'm not your average nigga
(Yo Ru! Yo these honeys be on some shit for real. Yo tell me about the
Other honey you was kickin' it to)
I met this honey named Tamika
My intentions was more than just to freak her
Since I'm God I thought that I would teach her
(Where'd you meet her at, black?)
At The Tunnel so you know it didn't happen like that
I got her name and her number
I said ""Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?"" She said ""Uh-uh
But you got the digits-ring me up tomorrow and see where it leaves ya at
We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting
She said ""Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I got mad respect""
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me on the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo
I'm not your average nigga
You see, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga
I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know I'm not your average nigga
*Scratch*- Change, nigga *scratch* - hear you comin' but your steps are too loud
Standing on the corner, thought him was cool-*scratch* - change
I met this honey named Sabrina
I thought that this time this one would be the Queen of
My dreams, but you know how that goes
(God, I heard it before)
So let me tell you what happened one day I'm outside her door
And we're talking about how her ex-boyfriend be stalking
She said she thought she saw him when we were walking
I said ""Don't worry about it
Put that shit on the side, and slide up in the crib""
So we're lampin', she's still shook up about what happened
I said ""Don't sweat it, he's probably just rappin'""
She said ""Little do you know
Last week he threw a brick threw my bedroom window""
I said ""Whatever, I don't think he's that crazy""
She said ""You never, know where he may be""
All of a sudden, out of nowhere
The crazy mothafucka jumped out on me
I made him melt with a blow to the head
And before I bounced, this is what I said
I said
Yo I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga
Mista, I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga

Ah check it out, ah check it out yo

Here's the remedy, for all your cornball raps
Brooklyn's back on the map, I'm not bragging
Defeating all foes, bring your styles, I stomp out the last dragon
Grand groove, Grandmaster, like back in the days
Holding my own, on the street and the microphone
You can't rip it, I grip it and flip it
Trip it down memory lane, back to the park jams
We used to spark jams, now niggas get jammed
Or should I say jelly?
 My vocals rip through your belly belly
You can't see me so you can't hit me
You ace deuce tre, I four five six and trips
Drums numb your ears, rhymes swell up your lips
Chicks gravitate towards the crooked
If your props are gone, then Brooklyn took it

""Brooklyn keeps on taking it""
""Brooklyn keeps on taking it""
""Brooklyn keeps on taking it""
""Brooklyn keeps on taking it""

Mindcrusher, spinecrusher,
 Brooklyn been banging
Making noise from the US to Russia
Couldn't set it, even if you wanted
So many bodies on my microphone, the shit's haunted
Doggonnit, your girl's on it
Record companies are on it, you can't have it, causing havoc
Building, destroying, deploying
My rhymes on beats strategically I melt any MC
I repre- aww fuck it, don't even gotta say it
You know the time when I start to sautee it
So niggas be having mad maws and shit
Cause Brooklyn stole the show like a grand larcenist
But ease up off us or you'll need officers
We're deadly, there's no cure
Boom bang em on down, treat competition like clowns

Serve your girl butt naked

Try to front and we retire
MCs set 'em all on fire, scooping up the fly ladies
Round my microphone like a Mercedes
The eighties. If I was a video game you couldn't play me
So keep it moving, don't play yourself
Your rhymes are semi-baffling, mine quite graffing
Switch up, change up, Brooklyn still gets biz
Plop plop, fizz fizz like Alka-Seltzer
Try to freak it, wind up in a homeless shelter
'Cause fuck what you heard, this is Crooklyn's casa
Try to see us, and it's an MC massacre
When we step, your state we shook it
If it's gone, no doubt, Brooklyn took it

How Ill,Still Rising,2007,"Skills? Skills?
Listen, I got crazy skills
I’ma tell you like this
I’m so ill I snatch the food out the hungry lion’s mouth
Jog from Brooklyn to DC on I 95 south
Without getting fatigued I travel at light speed
Get shot with a bazooka, dog can barely bleed
I can touch a lightning bolt, and not get shocked
Put shots at the president and won’t get knocked no shittin’
Swim with the sharks and I ain’t never been bitten
Have Nelson Mandela quoting the shit that I’m spitting
Make one phone call I get pulled me apart
And another call I kick it with Osama Bin Laden
Have every lesbian chick, begging for dick
Make that nigga Al Sharpton cut off that old perm shit
Spit fire out my mouth like the mythical dragon
Own a unicorn horn; smoke the blunt with the leprechaun
Squash ghetto beef before the weapons are drawn
Bring lash back to life and put his black ass on
To get this ill takes practice
Nasty
I’m so ill I have mike Bloomberg cutting me checks
Pimps instruct they hoes to pay me for sex
I make extra chips teaching David Blaine tricks
NASA called my lab before they launch rocket ships
So ill, Jackie Chan calls me the black version
After finished rapping I’ma be a brain surgeon
I can see the planets clearly without a telescope
Went to Rome to rock so they try to make me the Pope
I have Oprah in the crib posing for exotic flicks
Take a trip to Fort Knox and pick up like 80 bricks
Free all of the wrongfully imprisoned people out of jail
And when I’m finished with Oprah ill snap flicks of Gail
Ill rip the mic all night without taking a breath
Swim the Atlantic Ocean without taking a rest
Or getting wet
I always win so gamblers place your bets
I’m taking MC’s to Maury for maternity tests
To get this Ill takes practice
And it goes like this
I’m so ill they model computer chips after my brain
When a county in drought they call the kids for rain
Bring peace to the Gaza strip cause I got so much clout
Mario owe me dough for knocking Donkey Kong out
Wolfgang Puck gave me paper to teach me to cook
JK Rowlings asked me to write the next harry potter book
I can feed a million people with my peacea and jada
Darth Vader don’t really know I’m Luke Skywalker father
I spend my down time writing scripts for Scorsese
When I blow shit up I make the terrorists hate me
I’ma probably end up living until I’m one hundred and eighty
My stamina so legendary, wonder women trying to date me
My touch cures the sick, like an antibiotic
Slap up Steve Austin, and short out his bionics
Rap to a point just like a navy seal gunner
I’m taking shit over this summer and every summer
To get this Ill takes practice..",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-how-ill-lyrics

I was forced into a life of crime
Career criminal, now my career is crime
My mind is in a fucked up state
A brainwashed state, is the black man's fate, in the ground
Or locked down upstate
, 
when I was young I used to shoot for the stars
But got shot down by demons in patrol cars
Stars good cop, bad cop, stick up the crack spot
The ave won't get hot til one of their crew gets shot
Ask, Larry Davis, how much they took
Cops and crooks, but who's the crooks?
Take a nigga to jail, make bail, guilty or innocent
The system gets ten percent
Frontin like you're doin somethin
But you ain't sayin nothin, invasion

Come up in my cipher best believe I'mma dip on that ass
Beast-boy I'm professional heart of the ghetto
Raised, in the ways of thugs
Dodgin slugs, takin slugs, driving stolen automobiles
Skills fantastical
Living life on the edge it's dramatic, mad drama
I'm a fanatic, adrenalin addict
Getaway car, stick shift or automatic
Where's my crew at, you got your crew scopin
For a nigga up and down the Ave, it makes me laugh
Eat my nuts, eat my dust
I won't spend the night locked up or in handcuffs
Cuz in the concrete jungle, I got the right stuff
Smooth operator, pilot and navigator
Break out from oppression, my mission to escape
The, invasion",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-invasion-lyrics
Verses of Doom,Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4 Soundtrack,UnKnown,"(Jeru the Damaja...)
(...and it goes like this)
For all you new jacks that never heard me spit
Bring beats, rhymes, and freaks and watch me split shit
Bang like Bloods and Crips
Too legitimate to quit
MC's talk big but sonic waves crack your helmet
Before long, the chicken heads crush they pelvic
Bones, I blow up spot-slam microphones
Thinkin' 'bout pacing? Dog, adjust yo' tone
Fuck rhymin', I leave your eyes shinin' like chrome
Rims, Main course, knuckle sandwich and .10's
Try and wet me, I multiply like gremlins
I'm a vet in the game, I know the outs and ins
Still, I'm constantly beefin' like cowboys and Indians
Outlaw star, like Gene Starwind kickin' that crazy shit like a soccer hooligan
So money break yourself, you know what's good for your health
Call me ninja not nigga cuz I move in stealth
Mode, after this joint your headphones explode
I rhyme in beeps and blips so I can rhyme in morse code
Flow like ocean, salt water erode
When the mic is in my grip it is sure to corrode, and
I glide across the beat like Jordan
Leave competition hole-y like a Mormon
Potent as dust, I have you all stumblin'
Smoke too much, you space the fuck out like Flash Gordon
Rock this shit, from mornin' to mornin'
It's so hot it have rappers wanna stop recordin'
Sort of Superman, so Lois Lane reportin'
Swing like Spidey, so chumps hate me like Jay Jonah Jameson
If I miss I take aim again
Throwin' fire like the Human Torch and leavin y'all faggots flamin'
Play yo' fuckin' self if you think I'm gamin'
Create Earthquakes that have your core tremblin'
Be number 9 like the love potion
Can't clock my moves cuz I move in slow motion
(motion)
(motion)
(motion... and it goes like this)

Statik,The Sun Rises in the East,1994.0,"Electromagnetic beam, I get charged
Rhymes I run right through 'em like a big box of Trojan large
MCs tried to hang but it's a Brooklyn thing
Poison slang, poison fang
Poison pen let me begin
Tryin' to rhyme up in my cipher is gamblin'
Freestylin' me G, I be buckwildin'
You can't even challenge a nigga in my position
Technician, renditions more freaky than Rick James
Fly like airplanes through all it remain the same
My cuts like Freddy Krueger, don't need a German Luger
But shoot more shit than Sturm-Ruger
Dirty rottens comin' through punks cling to their guns
Don't start none, it won't be none
'Cause uhh... fuck around and it'll be tragic

And I could rock a rhyme with just statik
And I could rock a rhyme with just statik

Kool-Aid, you need aid, ejaculating
Rhymes like semen, MCs is scheming
Tryna bag me baby black you must be beemin'
Fiendin', I don't know who gassed ya head up
I'm straight up, for less niggas have got wet up
I'm on a mission, scrambling my enemies transmission
And when he least expect it, run up in his HQ
High IQ, every verse is EQed
Slither like a snake, still you can't elude
The neba, but not caneza
It's the toucha, no gun or God can protect ya
Neither the scripture, choke like a boa constrictor
This is my house and I'll evict ya
Big respect is automatic - black

I'll snatch up your girlfriend, her friend and their friends
I got the game and fame, she got the condoms
She's a victim, you shouldn't have that mouth dirty rotten
For the longest we knew you were plottin'
On the downfall, who stands tall, lick the balls
I'm not like that, so I smash out pussy walls
On the low, oh no, on the high
I get high, praise to the most high
Try to battle me, step up and die
Like the arc of the covenant I electrify
Petrify, intelligence I glorify
So devils are horrified
Sprayin' like pesticide, come commit suicide
Step into my realm and be fried

Revenge of the Prophet (Part 5),Wrath of the Math,1996.0,"Well Prophet
It seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself, Oh
And what you did to my wife
It was nothing, I have others
Hahahahahaha
The Saga Continues......

It's been a while since I escaped the library
Fightin ignorance everyday, its gettin weary
When I think I got him
He pulls a slip on me
And theres so many soldiers
In his fiendous ass army
One of the fiercest, is this nigga named Tricknology
The last time we met, he got the drop on me
Shit happens so fast he even got some of my family
Blasted my way up out the building
When I catch him Im gon kill him
Track him uptown, where I hear he's lyin to children
1-2-5th's the stop, go outside I hear gunshots
Run up the block
Greedy Lou's dead infront of the materialistic crack spot
Trick's yellin out this is my block
I would've hit him, but I didn't have a clear shot
An innocent bystander might get popped
Damn....a small thang cuz the prophet still can't be stopped

What...thats right, this is my motherfuckin life
Trick-nol-ogy, you know what Im sayin
You know me, you can't front on me....

Im in a fucked up position
But if he squeezes again, Im gon lift em
A few seconds later now here comes the siren
Oh shit its the pork chop patrol
Their on Ignorance's payroll
And they only came to hold...
Tricknolog down, scoup Greedy Lou off the ground
Throw him in the back of a truck
One yells 'What the fuck nigga ya lookin at?
Now get the fuck outta here'
Then I get that feeling that I feel when danger is in the air
Then out of nowhere one yells the Prophets over there
Immediatly following mad led is in the air
Picture all posted up like they knew I'd be here
I'd go for what I know
But shit there everywhere
Through in the back and forth my gun gets lost
But I managed to get one high powered thought off
I split 6 pigs that got sawed off
As their bodies break south I proceed to break north
Now shit is lookin dim and you'd think all maybe lost
But the Prophet won't go out at any cost
You could never stop the prophet....
Unit's 1 & 2, Unit's 1 & 2 the prophet has been sighted
If you see him kill him
 can't a damn thing stop me

I head toward the train station
My force did stop most of the ammunition
Still I need medical attention
But Im not bitchin ,gettin Ignorance is my mission
All of a sudden Greedy Lou comes creepin
Around the corner talkin bout..Prophet your a gonna
We knew you followed Trick uptown because you wanna
Get rid of Ignorance but that dont make no sense
He runs the world I know this from experience
Why don't you come & work wit us
You'll see the boss' game is nice
That night...Greedy Lou died twice
Now I'm wanted, pork chop patrol has a warrant
But that still can't stop the Prophet
Here ye, here ye the court of Ignorance is now in session
We, judge and the jury find the Prophet
Guilty in the murder of Greedy Lou
One of our close personal homeboys
So for that the sentence is death
When you find him execute him",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-revenge-of-the-prophet-part-5-lyrics
How I’m Livin’,Wrath of the Math,1996.0,"I got a freaky freaky freak, give you a freak, you turns 'em out
I put them hoes in a row and turn out Queens, no doubt
Don't need a vest, but flow like bullets freely through shootouts
I be the real supernatural, so check it out
I was conceived in the center of an inferno
The ninth month I slipped out my mom's vaginal
Cavity, now I'm surrounded by creeps and freaks
Had to watch my back in the New York streets
Fly, like an aeroplane, more powerful than the engine of an 
A train
Won't let it stress my brain
You know the fame that has men sold and bought
In a single bound, I let the criminal court
Walk through the desert and don't perspire
Touch the microphone, the whole joint catches afire
Use the opportunity to call the devil a liar
And I won't stop flipping shit until I'm forced to retire because
That's how I'm living

I can stroke all night and not bust a nut
Swim through a sea of razor blades and not get cut
When I do my thing I aim for the gut
And despise those nasty guys that hit shit in the butt
Blaze, like spliffs even back in the days
When I bag shit up like trays, nowadays
I bag 'em up like dimes and not even the Devil
Can stop me cause it's matter under mind
I'm fucking up your mind like a hallucinogen
(Are you hot, Lord?) 
I heat it up like halogen
Burn MC's, their children, and their children's children
Reverse polarity and make your girl's hell heaven
More intelligent than MacGyver
Quick to pull off on a stunt like an Indy car driver
Thoughts too intense, brainwaves cut like barbed wire
Since Run's a reverend, sucker MC's call me sire
Push for my mental forces to crush your fortress
Signals of distress, your whole squad's put to death
Bring your white Superman and I'll rip that fucking S off his chest
Cause that's just
How I'm living

I dedicate my life to taking snake heads
I break on the beats like scissors break on my dreads
Instead of eating beasts and living savagely
I aspire to excel to the highest degree
Of living, now how you living, like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Me? I keep it tight and lock it down like a virgin pops
From crack rocks to suburb-ian blocks, I'm hot
Don't forget or have you forgot that I'm a surgeon, Ak-
Bar, once outran a jaguar
Slept in a lion's den and escaped without a scar
Close my eyes and commence the star travel
Fred Flintstone's out a job because I turn hard rocks to gravel
Babble, never, con-trol the weather
Like a few jams back, whatever's clever
Even the rudest of rude can't test because I'm protected
With the Breastplate of Righteousness
 and that's just
How I'm living",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-how-im-livin-lyrics
Friends or Foe,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Friends is a word that I use loosely
Because you never know who these people may be
Some you just miss them, you know from way back
When you used to dig brock and snatch chains and sell crack
Rollin every day, getting high-er than a ball
But when you play them too close they'll be your downfall
Fast going to the picture, many things have changed
Now the same old friends start acting strange
You probably, fox with me
You even pop shots with me
But now you hissing like a snake so friends turn enemy
And it really dont matter what you've been through
Cause your friend will fuck your bitch and put a bullet in you
Sleep in your bed, drive your car, spend your ends
But these are the people that we call friends

Friends
How many of us have them
I have none
Thought I had one
Friends
How many of us have them
Thought I had one
But I have none
Friends, friends

I re-member, we started out together
Back then I said yo we be down forever
I always thought I was a brother to you
We were friends, tight, like the Awesome two
But now look whats happened to you
Putting your trust in the shady individuals
And get screwed, still I hope you fine
Sometimes you cross my mind
Constantly reminded by the sword marks on my spine
They say all wounds heal in time but not mine
Nightmares of my friends creeping up from behind
Bloody murder, while the crimes un-solved
A friends a friend until loot is involved
Sell you out, for a house and a job
And spit on your grave in the end, but
These are the people that we call friends
Friends

First things first
Stop the jealousy and envy
I depend on minds, offkey, to fool enemies
Like your homeboy with your wifey
You can't believe it
Seeing is one thing
But hearing its some shit
Every which way she dip
Every thought was unpleasent
I got, carried away, did you free OJ
Cause I want a slave's bitch
I heard she did tricks
Like Vanessa suck your dick
On sunset strip
And my man flip
Like see low dice on six
We used to sell crack
And do sticks for bricks
Bustin shots at all, other criminals care
But they scared to do a mother fucking bid
Listen
Now we rock
Got a block thats hot
Like b-boys on the block thats got all watch
Dont get knocked, that my man
He had me here
Could this be my hollow saying your my fam
But damn, you should have used kung-fu
A .22 or some type of voodoo
To snatch out my heart
Cause friends are really enemies from the start",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-friends-or-foe-lyrics

When there just is

The other night
Jeru: I'm sayin' I'm with it, just set it off
Afu: Yo, after this, there's no turning back
Jeru: I'm saying, just set it off!

Physical paralysis, open your chest like a chalice
MCs couldn't strike movements we wish to brandish
I'm tormentin', mind states lyrical warrior
I flow through, fuck the mic, I fuckin' floor ya
Headlocks and armlocks, necks is gettin' broken
No jokin', format'll leave your whole borough smokin'
Fist of five rings,
 I fling MCs to the gutter
Samurai sharp, more deadly than box cutters
Ultimate as I emit your death blow
Perverted Monks, and Jeru with the combo

Peter Piper picked peppers
And Run rocked rhymes but now he rock hymns
I got G through my meridians, the physical extremities
Indomitable, the spirit can't be broken
But jaws are broken and even backs are broken
Think you're on point, well let your points of pressure open
Foot and fist got your head hangin' open
The breath rebirth
I damage in the mental and physical universe
You quake the earth when you hit face-first
Brake before it gets worse
But those that thirst for abuse get loose
'Cause soon I'll be around that neck tight like a noose
God, show improvement

More strength than the Juggernaut, electric like Magneto
Know you couldn't test Mental, or now the sequel
I slip to the floor for the grapple
I crack your collarbone while I bust your Adam's apple
Spleens get ripped out the backs of your raps
Broken down fractions as you start to make actions
It's too elusive how I'm quicker than Bruce's
Silver surfin', the universe is now its astrological
As I proceed in my vehicle
You can't stop it, fiber-optic, so you watch it
Sophistry, with so much fury
You can't get with me
Fight scenes are left bloody
Poisonous, taoist
My thoughts make plates shift
Some may call this tectonics
But airwaves from miles I boil by my sonics
It's ironic, got MCs hooked on phonics
So physical styles I construct like bionics

Displaced joints like Shaolin should not
Furious roundhouses cause bones to splinter
Protect your feet, legs, midsection and neck
'Cause I'm here to let you know it's not just on 
AMPEX
We wrecks, and more than just figuratively
Let it be known that we bringin' it physically
And the effect is bodily harm
No chance to pull your firearm
For the body move swift and the mind stay calm
Ways shift like the moment before the storm
Watch my form, it's deadly
Come too close, it could get bloody and ugly
You think that you could stop me?
Perverted Monks, so now we apply pressure
This Stamina's style is iller than its predecessor
Dial witch professor, mix up the elixir
Internal power, MCs we devour",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-physical-stamina-lyrics
"Me, Not the Paper",Classic Works Of Mart Vol. 1,1997.0,"""Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me an my dreams
See what I mean, Black?"" ""I gets the paper""

Microphone thugs, flip keys and shit
'member the '80's when niggas was acting crazy?
The mean streets raised me
I used to live dangerously
Amidst crack-selling armed and dangerous felons
Plus murderers, drug spot burglars
Niggas doing anything to acquire that paper
Lived the life of crime but got saved by the rhyme
Peace to all my niggas doing time on top of time
Plus the ones gunned down in their prime
I made it this far because of Divine design
Diamond, flooded chains the sun still outshines
I get you drunk off my drink like that champagne wine
As long as there's breath left, I father the fatherless
If shit was real, Brooklyn would snatch that chain off your chest
Don't fess, we know why you rock that vest
Hard on records, but really pussy, check it
I do this for me, and not the paper, strictly a hundred percent

(""'Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me and my dreams
See what I mean, Black?"") (""I gets the paper"")

It started way before Super Rhymes
Peace to mom dukes for enduring hard times
God bless all the victims of my past life crimes
I do this for the ghetto youth living like Good Times
Flipping rhymes saved me from the obvious traps
In '97, studio hustlers push crack on wax
And breaking backs, but faking jacks
If it wasn't for contracts, they wouldn't bust caps
So, destroy your people and collect huge stacks
Fat Ac's, and platinum plaques
Come bring it back, rewind it that old gangster bullshit
Got the youth running around criminal minded
Not a player hater, just don't chase the paper
Got a little deal so some heads caught the vapors
So stupid motherfuckers throw your guns in the air
To all my niggas who ain't make it past their 19th year
I do it for me, and not the paper
Strictly a hundred percent, nah mean?

(""'Cause ain't no fiends coming in between me and my dreams
See what I mean, Black?"") (""I gets the paper"")

Sinister plots, every week who got shot
Spots like the Enterprise kept the neighborhood hot
Niggas bugging out so some receive toe tags
Resting up north with fags or sporting shit bags
When I think back it's so sad
All the niggas I had, who'd ever figure that it'd get so bad?
So I retreat with a pen and a pad
Hide your chain when you're ridin' the train
Fuck writing rhymes about automatic weapons
I'd rather steer the youth in the right direction
Drop a bomb, destroy the 10 percent section
Little girls already sexing
Hard rock shorties is flexing
But I stick to my lessons, no stress
'Cause if shit was real, Brooklyn would snatch that chain off your chest
Don't fess, we know why you rock that vest
Hard on records, but really pussy, check it
I do this for me, and not the paper
Strictly a hundred percent, know what I'm saying?

To ever, ignite the mic, get it right
Mad respect, pimps grap your hoes
Punks grab your checks
What's next, pure nonsense and the styles ya flex
And your so bloody pussy, you need a kotex
Latex cause they're drippin' vaginal juices
So many so called gangsta niggas and their booty producers
Now watch the act that's vanishin'
Gold and platinum, but who gets the publishin'
Not to rub it in, drop it in your box, now your dubbin'
My company fucked up my projects momentum
But I'm still winnin'

It's too perverted, you heard it
So deep, that it becomes fossilized
Too many times I find my style between MCs inside
(?), but they swallow their tongues like seizures
I pierce flesh and strike nerves like accupuncture
Or accupressure, feel the wrath of my mathematics
Kinetics, you need a local anesthetic
Cause your system has acquired an immune deficiency
Overwhelmed by my telepathy, no sympathy
Curse Caligula but graceful like calligraphy
And (?) like (?) was not to mc
Life givin, yet I'm still deadly
And before you step to me
Remember it's too perverted
It's too perverted
It's too perverted, you heard it

Mastered rhymin so I'm steadily climbin
I rip through mics like when my dick strikes the hymen
Total controller, some claim to be bolder
But they rotate around the lunar
I keep it solar, polar
Who vibrates and radiates
Thunder, lightning, earthquakes from north to south
East to west test the best get scraped
Drop jewels, burn papes, til my ride escapes
Awkward flow to some it's even unorthodox
Bone crushin, life threatnin like the jaws of a crocodile

I'm sorry if we kicked it and we got too close
I can't deal with commitment so I'm sorry I'm ghost

Dibs, the one's that quickest to draws, the one that lives
My niggas in the ghetto, know what time it is
Makin moves like a chess wiz, gotta feed my eight kids
I need deep and pussy pampers, cribs and bibs
Day to day, is how a nigga lives
Nothing's what a nigga is
So he ends up in pri-
Zon, I think ya pussy so go get ya son
Tough ass rappers, crazy talk no action
Got freaky stunts, bring some
Makin all Queens in my kingdom
Eighty niggas can't get a crumb
Dizzy broads with dope bodies, a dime a dozen
Bottom line the pussy bangin, it'll make me cum
Chorus 6X
Jagaurs, strip bars, ghetto supastar
Me and ya pussy out on the road, whippin ya car
I'm takin off her bra, she gettin bucked baby pa
Look new, but true, fuck like a pro likes action
No camera, co reck it and leave a scar
Niggas is fake and rough, but sweet like spar-tacus
Bust, dutch us and bringin the ruckus
Money makin brothers wanna fight and fuss
Cruisin out my flesh light, plus make playas look ridiculous
Trying hard, but can't stop the bumrush
Sun trust, all the temples I crush, ya must back up
Spontaneous combustion
Forty five freaks inside my dungeon
When I get paid I want it in a lump sum
Lick a shot and cause pandemonium
Crazy niggas in jail or the insane asylum
Brooklyn Brooklyn is where I'm from
Three minutes and some change and I still ain't say none

Solar Flares,The Hammer,2014.0,"Ayo the way I move defies the laws of physics
I travel through dimensions writing rhymes with the mystics
I reread the fabric of time to be specific
I maneuver through the universe young, black, and gifted
Divine design swift as Tachyon particles
Live from the trenches of Brooklyn it’s the original
Chemistry unaltered by synthetic chemicals
Blessed with the power of God delete your physical
Difficult time only further strengthen the spiritual
Yea that’s crystal clear I fear no individual
No  in every line that I rhyme
I’m immersed the soul of soldier from the birth to the Earth
Study the verse my work is so superb it’s a curse
My mind extremely sharp when I think my head hurts
If I keep killing the flow I’m afraid it’ll burst
And the force it generates will destroy the universe

The listener’s symptom is  like solar flares (4x)

Mind over matter help me explore the galaxy
Time moving things with my rhymes mental telepathy
Chemicals combine with beats advanced alchemy
Math and science master microphone wizardry
Ahead of time futuristic technology
God in the physical form anthropology
Raw bloodline divine genealogy
The word in the time before time cosmogony
Atomic energy flow heterodoxy
Most philosophy is hypocrisy
In the death of the cosmos I’m totally free
Good thing I’m mostly water cuz life is a tree
Here’s the scoop: even in Allah there’s the truth
I’m  roots you know what it is by the fruits
I speak couth the beach fuck biochemical suits
I’m afraid the heat I generate will melt the booth


My vessel is average but my spirit is colossal
2000 years what I write will be the gospel
I send you to life like O2 through your nostrils
Riding lighting bolts trading tales with apostles
Saying do things that’s deemed impossible
Master my realm so in fact it’s logical
Camel through the eye of the needle improbable
Feast for your ears in the flavor delectable
Orgasmic voice but it’s far beyond sexual
Borderline mythical baffle the intellectual
Dissect your science to the last molecule
So electric my brainwave is measured in Joules
The flow intoxicating like a gallon of booze
Universal law and order reinstate the rules
Fate is what you make it
Be wise when you choose
This rhyme a landmine
Blow you out your shoes",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-solar-flares-lyrics
Billie Jean (Safe Sex),Heroz4Hire,1999.0,"Yo Yo Yo, I'm 'bout to tell you 'bout the time
I ran into Billie Jean
Shorty that Michael Jackson sung about on his joint
Yo she was a crazy freak
She use to be buggin' out and all that yaknamean
I'm about to drop it on you
And this story is a hundred percent true
Word to Bill Clinton's
Mother

Sexy and brown (damn!)
I met her downtown
I said hey lady (hey!)
Your workin' body drives the average nigga crazy
I'm Jeru love she said her name was Billie
I continued keep your minds intact girl you could have my baby
She could've played me
But smiled and replied behave G
I like your style knotty so maybe you can get to know me
And this, not mack son, it's physical attraction
I know you have a woman
My man's Michael Jackson (yo, my man's Michael)
I think she's gassin' she can tell by my reaction
A few seconds passed we both bust out laughin'
Not sayin' I'm all of that or a P-I-M-P
Still spit that magnetic, G, that had her clingin' to me (one!)
Regularly, and I won't speak on what this dip would do
But what I'll say she was my freak for about a week or two
And if I, tell you the rest you won't believe it
It involves Michael Jackson
Babies and shit
But first

Billie Jean, she was my part time lover
I used a rubber
So blame it on some other muthafucka
Unlike Mike, I'll admit I mashed it for fun
But shorty ain't my son, and I ain't the one
Straight up, Billie Jean, she was my part time lover
I used a rubber
So blame it on some other muthafucka
Unlike Mike, I'll admit I mashed her for fun
But shorty ain't my son, and I ain't the one

This honey was freaky
I did sexual favors for her
Bent willie in her girlfriends Mona Lisa, Roxanne, and Latoya
Straight like that but probably not in that order
On planes, trains, automobiles and even underwater
On a mission in any position that you ever thought of
And think I'm bullshittin I got it all on camcorder
One time handled mine worked the spines of them dimes
They like, all passed out so it's time to recline ya know?
Go in my jeans I get the dark cocoa, old school style
Split the El producto
Hearin' noise in the back, by the kitchen so (what's that?)
I creep and investigate like 5-0 (yo!)
You couldn't fathom, what happened next yo
Michael Jackson comes crashin' through the window
Rantin' and ravin' like you dirty so and so
I'm like Mike, that's a hoe baby you know how that go
I spoke mad clear but he wasn't hearin' me though
He start kickin' and punchin' like he knew taekwondo
He threw a blow, so I got real low
I got my draws and my socks headed for the front do'
Stepped outside stopped short oh no!
Went back in dropped the El producto
Put fire to it and continued to flow
And I ain't seen Billie after that no more
Hey yo

Billie Jean, she was my part time lover
I used a rubber
So blame it on some other muthafucka
Unlike Mike, I'll admit I mashed it for fun
But shorty ain't my son, and I ain't the one
Straight up, Billie Jean, she was my part time lover
I used a rubber
So blame it on some other muthafucka
Unlike Mike, I'll admit I mashed her for fun
But shorty ain't my son, and I ain't the one

Like I said after that I ain't see her no more
10 months down the line I bump into her on tour
She said the hat must of snapped when you got my draws
'Cause I got a little son and guess what duke he's yours
I paused then was like aight let me see him
Shorty had one white glove talkin' 'bout heeeheeeheee
You ain't call me through the whole pregnancy
We need a DNA test to determine paternity
Billie start flippin' talkin' 'bout you ain't gonna marry me
I said 'Ru's not the one that gets burnt that easy baby baby

Billie Jean, you was my part time lover
I used a rubber
So blame it on some other muthafucka
Unlike Mike, I'll admit I mashed it for fun
But shorty ain't my son, and I ain't the one
Straight up, Billie Jean, you was my part time lover
I used a rubber
So blame it on some other muthafucka
Unlike Mike, I'll admit I mashed her for fun
But shorty ain't my son, and I ain't the one

So bounce baby
Straight up
It's not me
I'm not the one
Go get somebody else

It's just not happenin'
I'm bouncin' peace

The Crack,Still Rising,2007.0,"Yeah, Jeru the Damaja
The master of microphone mayhem
Representing that real hip-hop
You know, I don't know what the fuck ya'll motherfuckers is doing
But I'll be spitting that dope
Know what I mean?
I put it down like this:

I always get respect, I'm high-tech like computer love
Niggas don't approach me talk tough but  mostly
And even though you holler I don't think that you're rough enough
Fuck it money knuckle up and get your shit bust
I'm so funky even rock-n-roll heads want me
Come off the wall get cracked the fuck up like humptey, dumptey
I'm busting shots like I'm still on the block
Real G's hold their own, fake thugs call the cops
Dont need guns, just the warriors drums
Of course, the force, rip off your mog like dum-dums
So go ahead and act dumb
I use my mike like a magnum
And send you back where you came from
Wild on the track, run first shut the spot down
Cats is getting hurt, like convicts on lockdown
On the real, I'm that negro pound for pound
Leave your click wet like water, break your mp3 recorder
Play lowkey, but never sneak like a ninja
So much the Man, crackers in the clan wanna be a nigga
Go figure, now i  your honey figure, Moe
Pop your luck in the hood then Moe liquor
Get them tipsy, like Heineken mixed with 'Henney
Burn MC's worse than Kenwill Mars burn penny
On good times, I'm the  for rocking minds
My pops the root on the block, with the fat dimes
True climbs and confessions, jam sessions, heads bop, chickens' heads quap, they said they prese 'cause like blessin'
The Lord never stressin', fuck you perception, I'm the motherfucker on the mike; no question
From state to state, I'm holding mad weight
But not drugs, the bulletproof munk deflects slugs of hate
Where's my hat, I'm 'bout to dig out your date
I guess you's a lame, she says she like the way I love me
All hail the king when I swing like kong
Stay cool and calm, blow like an atom bomb
Blow shit up
Like Zorro, you can call me the Don Diego
Fuck a hook I got 'em hooked like yayo
 Brooklyn cats just don't know how to act
Fuck what you thought was dope, this shit is the crack

The Prophet,Still Rising,2007.0,"""Ayo Prophet, yo Phophet, we need your help
 on fighting for the TVs and the radio
Everywhere you look, it's Envy, Hatred, Greed, Jealousy
You can't move, the city is suffocating
You have to help us, help us, please""

Shorty said she need a solder, so I'm back no doubt
Last time I had to scrap with Ignorance, he damn near took me out
See I can't do it myself so I allow myself with Patience
Cat that I rolled with in the past turn out to be double agents
Thought I killed this dude before, he had a million clones of Hatred
And he keep trying to stop me like the guys in The Matrix
I'm fighting for my life when I realize that I'm fucked
In the mist of the firefight, my weapon jams up
I don't move as quick as I used to, so I almost get stuck
And when I tried to escape, I catch a slug in my gut
Despair laughing at me talking 'bout ""we got you, nigga""
There's an explosion, I'm scooped up by a mysterious figure
We flew off in a helicopter
Not a ghetto bird, but a military black hawk chopper
I wonder who would help me, it ain't make no sense
It wasn't Pride, 'cause he has a goal, he start working with Arrogance
""Who are you, why'd you save me, what's this all about?""
I'm barely hanging on, I'm nearly passing out
Then the voice said ""don't worry love, you're safe with us""
It was this chick named Seduction from this clique called Lust
After that, I feel a sharp pain in my back
They hit me with a sedative and everything went black

""Madam Seduction, you have to come and see this
I've never seen anything like this before in all my years of practice in medicine
This graph reference is the brain activity normal-vested human being
This is The Prophet's current brain activity
It seems he placed himself in some sort of a self-induced coma, allowing him to heal three times as fast as a normal human being
Moves like this, he should be out for a week
While His vital signs is stabilizing
I think he's coming, too""

I woke up a few days later in a hospital bed
Kinda dizzy from the drugs, bandages on my head
The wound on my stomach had been cauterized closed
Snatched the IV out my arm, ""where the fuck are my clothes?""
A nurse named Essence runs in, said that I should relax
If I waited a few moments, Seduction would be back
She came in and said that she want to make me an offer
Something about the way she spoke, I couldn't keep my eyes off her
Then I started feeling woozy so I sat my ass down
She said Ignorance days is numbered, Lust is taking over town
I did not understand the motive of the seductress
'Cause I remembered when she murdered Truth and Justice
Now here's where the situation gets complex
If I take Ignorance down, would The Prophet be next?
I remember the words of Wisdom, so I answered with note
Then she informs me that I'm poisoned and she has the antidote
I flew into a rage and started flipping shit over
Seduction held her ground, keeping her composure
She said ""you're wasting time fucking with me
You had 24 hours, now you have 23""

""Hello Seduction. Did The Prophet take the bait?
Oh he did, did he?
For your sake, I hope he shows up on time
Because if he doesn't, your sister will make a lovely addition to my harem
Ahahahahahahahahaha
Ahahaha""

They gave me hi-tec weaponary and all the pertinent information
Maps, floor plans, and Ignorance location
He changed up the game since our first confrontation
He used to play the library, but now it's the TV station
My 7th sense told me I was in grave danger
So I hit my man Courage on his two-way pager
I hope he gets the message if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm down to our 18
I cut through the lock with the laser beam
I took out Anger and Fear, some of the meanest guys on Ignorance team
I make it to the next locked door as I start to cut
All the lights come on, another motherfucking set up
My finger's on the trigger, but before I could bust
I'm disarmed by Seduction and surrounded by Lust
A bunch of female assassins with asses fatter than strippers
I hear a buzzing noise, and they had them clippers
My chest tightens up, I fall down
The clippers hit my head, my dreads hit the ground
Seduction comes over, looks me in the face, and gives me a kiss
I'm thinking ""it can't end like this""

History 101,Still Rising,2007.0,"Plans are made destined to change the course of history

In 1441 two Portuguese captains pick up twelve Africans
Brought them to Cabo Branco Portugal the slaves
This is the beginning of the slave trade
There were so successful that just four years after
A tax collector from Lagos set up trade with Africa
This was in about 1444
Don't go nowhere cause there's a whole lot more
In 1452 the first time sugar was planted on an isle in Portugal
That's the year Pope Nicholas V proclaimed
That if you're not a Christian, your ass can be put in chains
For years the Portuguese monopolized the slave game
There were so large they set up shop in Seville, Spain
Now in 1476
Despite papal opposition the Spanish got down with this shit
It was a captain named called Carlos de Valera
He brought back 400 men from Africa
1481 Diogo de Azambuja
Builds a castle at Elmina, that’s modern day Ghana
Not only was it one of the days busiest ports
It was also one of the slavery‘s most notorious forts
1483 the discovery of the Congo river
A goldmine if your goal was enslaving niggas
1492 Columbus sails the ocean blue
(yeah all right, once again................)
After months and months of sea, death and all types of drama
Chris stands on San Salvador, modern day Bahamas
1493 on Columbus' second voyage
He starts the transatlantic trade enslavin‘ the Taino village
He brought them from Hispaniola, that’s the D.R. to Spain
It gets even more insane
1499 Vespucci and Hojeda take natives from South America this time
When Columbus did it there were legal issues in the past
This time he had no problems selling their native ass
1500 it starts to get real ill
Pedro Cabral sets foot on Brazil
1502 a guy named Juan Córdoba
It’s the first merchant on record to send Africans over
He was only allowed one by Spanish authorities
But other dirty merchants sent two or three
1509
Columbus' son Diego Colón governor of the empire at that time
Said the native slaves were lazy and they worked too slow
1510 fifty black slaves are shipped to Santo Domingo
1513 Ponce de Leon
The first European to touch American soil
He landed on the coast
Modern day Florida as it‘s known to most
1516 on a ship a huge native slave rebellion
They killed the crew and sailed back home 1519 here comes Magellan
1521 Cortés slaughtered the Aztecs
1522 two slaves in Espanola break their masters necks
1526 the Germans put slaves on ships
1532 the Pizarro kills the Incas and shit
1532 the English get into the mix
John Hawkins brought back blacks, potatoes and tabacco from his trips
1579 the united provinces is formed
And the trading machine of the Dutch is born
Now I can dope on and on and on and on
But for practical reasons it‘ll take to long
To all my brothers claiming that they‘re Hispanic and Latino
You’re African, Aztecs, Indian and Taino
Now that I showed you how this nations gained their wealth
I hope I keep your interest so check it out for yourself",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-history-101-lyrics

War, my skills is this spelled backwards
I perform for the white kids but do this for the black kids
To get this ill takes practice I'm takin' over
The industry with ghetto verbal and tactics
Hard times build muscle like lactic acid
Some entertainers losin' they minds
Makin' porns pissin' on kids
The streets is ill save the theatrics
I still treat a bitch like a bitch
While y'all niggas is doin' backflips
I can't trip I guess it's part of the game
Like Ja-Rule bitin' my name
Like MJ glowin' up in flames
Like chickens suckin' dick for fame
As things change I remain the same
Tryin' to keep sane
While many strugglin' to maintain
The stress of ghetto livin' can bust ya brain
It seems the road is paved with less joy than pain
I wanna regress but I refrain
If I don't I rage war
Right here in the streets of New York
Some talk the talk, but don't walk the walk
Like Muslems at the corner store sellin' pork
My little brother still outlined in chalk
They went from forties to the champagne court
Videos and true lies makin' all the birds squalk
Little girls butt naked so the president's stalk
My man say he was god holdin' the devil's pitchfork
That's why I'm throwin' rhymes like Geronimo's tomahawk

War, many shout it but don't wanna see it
I stay low and lay boobytraps like the cong in Viet..nam
Loud talkin' and stares can't do me harm
Know some niggas wanna stop it I'm still droppin' the bomb
Shit is death like Tennessaucee ring the alarm (ring the alarm)
It's still a mystery to you like the 82nd psalm
Some fight 'til the end some sell out like Uncle Tom
So much contempt others that's flow with they 
jelly like napalm
War, is more than hand to hand and firearms
It's only won when the mind is calm
So I study 
Sun-Tzu
 and 
stopped smokin' chron'
In my left hand riches, long life in my right palm",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-war-lyrics

Some people lying to themselves, I deal in actual facts
Press too hard and you will get smacked, this is more than just talk
I procede to produce beats, knock your tooth loose
Seeing is believing, dog, here's the proof
I chef this up in the lab and a makeshift sample
Back up against the wall, and still fighting
When I thought it was no rhymes left to write, I kept writing
Saw my brothers in South Africa, they were inspiring
And if at first you don't succede, then keep trying
World tours, keep me counting my blessings
Snakes in my circumference, help me learn from life lessons
Had to analyze the wire, just his greatest question
And even when you think a brother's down, I'm steadily pressing
Keep banging out those studio session
And when they think they know my next move, I keep 'em quessing
It's only logical

Explosive verses blow ya mind like a terrorist
Bust a verbal shot in the crowd, the pro activist
Used to smoke that ganja but it left me listless
This is off the subject, but rhyme too hard, you just might break ya neck
Don't know what's popping, dog, I'm still in effect
And the moves that I make, help me finance my own project
The road gets rough but I'm still climbing
And, even on the cloudiest days, I'm still shining
Like coal one day he can become a precious diamond
The pressures of the world, refine the souls of some men
Others let they being, become filled with hate
And they take it to the grave of the pen, my ball point right
Trying to decipher the lies from the truth
Everybody claim they got the proof
Everybody claim they got the juice
Everybody know the formula, but if you follow
Will you win or lose? It's only logical
*Logical* - scratched up

The jewels I drop hit like dope in ya fiends
Although it's dope, it's not the dope you smoke like crack cocaine
Still my product can drive you insane
And on that same note, I flip the mic like drugs
The game's like fiends that cutthroat
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding is the gun that I tote
When the waters get stormy I'm sure to stay afloat
Is this brother for real, the answer is True Indeed
I move a mountain with a mustard seed
You do the research, smack a sucka with the truth
Because we know the truth hurts
And you can talk all you want, but you judge by ya words
Not exploiting no freaks, but I'm constantly pimping
The system, making a killing like O.J. Simpson

Swing my sword wit precision
Lightning speed blurs your vision

Study lessons and plant seeds to fertilize

Spit flyin straight at my mouth is holy water

The dopest high grade
This a raid
Nobody move, nobody get sprayed
Mind blower
Slam into your planet like a meteor
Insane flame thrower
Sporting rhymes galore
Its the hardcore
Hitting like a two by four
And if you think that its a game lame
I still tap your jaw, its war
You could call the whole Marine Corp
I take 'em out one by one
Similar to the Predator
Word to mother
You ain't know why I'm a bad mother fucker
From the streets of east New York
To the gutters of Calcutta
I ain't stutter
This is the say you sucker emcees will lay
Lyrical AK, you can say is how my mind spray
Dropping bombs on the spot
Like if its D-Day
I make you wanna quit rap and take up ballet
Tinkerbell ass mother fuckers
Its Brooklyn

Word is born

So leave it alone
You weak and (?)
When you address me watch your tone
Niggas is clones
Faker than titties of silicone
On the real
When did emcess start standing for (?)
Get your head flown
My rap snaps your backbone
And your poems are so weak
They need shots of testosterone
I'm probably dead wrong
But you remind me of estrogen
Talking tough like a killa
Bust off with that baby skin
And daffodils
But here's the deal, I'm for real
I'm blessed with pure skill
And harder than raw steel
(?) like Steven Segal
Hard To Kill
And my rhymes more exotic than those broads in Brazil
No holds barred
I go hard when its time to record
Murder beats and in the sheets
Freaks they call me ultralord
If you get caught in the crosshairs
Do you will get clapped
Peel your skull cap back black
So call it a rap
So

Verbal Battle,Heroz4Hire,1999,"Intro: Jeru The Damaja
In the time when hip hop was strong
The Supahuman Klik ruled the land
Bringin that futuristic hip hop, presently in time
The first lieutenant in arms of the Supahuman Klik
Was the all mighty, all powerful, Miz Marvel
I think she can describe it how she does better
{Miz Marvel}
Thought I disappeared now that the smoke has cleared
I come from times with inabitions, face to face with fears
While shootin stars wishing that I can shift my gears
So I raise my glass eye, I drink to that, say cheers
And let the fire water wash away the tears, burn like salt
On open wounds, thoughts consume all consetions
Give birth to these rhymes like an oral C-section
Uhh, positive connection throughout the galaxy
Time to switch to reality, make proper arrangements
For the souls of fatalities
It's the same for niggas that stuck with that slave mentality
Or these wack ass rappers, they got no originality
But my mentality, helps me travel around the galaxy
Time gets shorter, I'm on the water, run insanity
It seems like everyone was after me
Three's a nasty girl like Vanity
Make niggas wild, I smoke la, anything to keep my sanity
Ain't got no friends, everyone with me is family
If they standing next to me, nothing's what it seems to be
Sending energy, when I rhyme, but no time for idol questions
If freestyling is my bible, when I fall in hip hop sessions
Of the tribal blessings, lessons to be learned
Respect had to be earned and not given
On the fourth of them but not amongst the men that living
Guy collides, when selfish minds can't asked to be forgiven
Ain't no turning back the hands of time
When past spirits have risen
{scratching}
Black, black, black
Verbal, power, verbal, power
{Miz Marvel}
Power of the moon and the force of a sonic boom
Help me heel like battle wounds, to that shit I'm immune
We come thru like the first platoon, into smoke filled rooms
Into it seems like magic mushrooms, from the womb to the tomb
I got a meetin in the ladies room, I be back real soon
O-o-oh o-o-o-oh
And all pro, precise position, like a crossbow
To strike the deathblow, continue with a never ending flow
Friend or foe, gas heads go from C.E.O. to skid row
See the toxic green flow, it's poison waters overflow
Paint a mental picture, lyrical Michaelangelo
Words pierced with the sting of a scorpio
Beats mad bong, to collapse the Walls of Jericho
Overflow and explore, I hope you got your blunts rolled
Cuz this is the same, no matter which zip code
My minds pro, bitches is robbed
Suckin the diamonds out your ear lobe
I keep it tracked like a barcode of Illuminati
And fight these devils back with the Code of Hammurabi
{more scratching}
{Miz Marvel}
I strike with magnum force, send you on a collision course
With no remorse, I tap the source and knock you off ya high horse
While beats and rhymes have intercourse to reproduce their first born
Ever sworn not to make the same mistakes as there parents
Written on there face, time worn sharpen then a poison desert storm
Step on first month Capricorn, quiet storm
Jeans and boots my everyday uniform
Elegants ruffness and innocence, if ever given a form
Hell have a fury like a women scorned
My niggas strife to perform, I struggle to break the norm
Give me any platform and I perform lyrical firestorms
I make it hot, you keep it lukewarm
From hotels to college dorms, keep these niggas souls torned
{More scratching}
Lot of other people, other groups aware of these consciousness
Virtually impossible to defend against (repeated over and over)",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-verbal-battle-lyrics

And quick wit, fully equipped, mental lie detection

You forget to count your blessings, all in the mix
Sold your soul for it's weight in gold bricks
Bitchez wit dikz, with chips like chicks
Only talk with snares and tits
In the time of revolution, be the first to submit
Try to be God, but there mental seem unfit
Speakin mathematics, but quick to kiss a crucifix
Won't admit that their style is rip and counterfeited
Contradict, sell their men to bang their fit, a moving target

Whatyagonnado,Divine Design,2003,"3 in the morning, you hop on the train
3 Brooklyn fiends is scheming on your chain
Mad blunts and licks to the head, you red
Better sober up quick or you might get dead
There's no one around so ain't no reason to scream out
Here's your chance to be a gangsta nigga, back that thing out
The next move you make will decide your fate
Will it be die on the train or live life behind the gate
You framing minor , you contemplate prison rape
Your heart skip a beat and you select upstate
It's on, you get a lump in your throat, niggas weapons are drawn
You so shook, you shoot straight through your coat
2 down, 1 boogie but before you gone
The train stops and one of New York City's Finest jumps on

""Whatchu gonna do.."" 

2:30 in the morning on a friday night
It's one of those types of nights that everything's goin right
In a club, fishing for bitches, anything tryin to bite
Then the one that you want gets caught in your sight
Face - picture perfect, big titties and fat ass
She's asked if she wanna drink and she kindly pass
Her response let you know she's not the average stunt
She asks ""do you got a dutch"", you say ""yeah"", she roll a blunt
Weed and conversation good, you fill the evening with laughter
Then Shorty like: ""yo, whatchu doing after""
She continues what she's doing is outta character
But, she live's alone and she wants you to smash her
You bug, you can't believe that she tryin to fuck
You like: ""let's bounce"", then you think ""Lady Luck""
You exit the club, hop up in your truck
But when you get to Brooklyn East New York, you get stuck up

""Whatchu gonna do.."" 

1 a.m. - you in the studio, dropping verses about how you flip kilos
Get paper commit murder and pimp on hoes
Crazy ice around your neck with the thugged out flows
But it sounds like game to the street wise pro's
Cause you be blabbing the  that you don't even know
Straight pillow talking, I hope you walk the walk
And be doing all the shit that's blasting out of shortie's walkman
The last verse is laid, your men is like  dope fiend
All of a sudden the sound  wide open
3 niggas come in, screaming ""where the cash""
And you know the shit is real cause they ain't rocking masks
They rocking big ass canons dawg, you better think fast
Do you run what's yours or go for yours and blaaast..

Great Solar Stance,Heroz4Hire,1999.0,"What niggas do in they last 24, I did in the first
Before the doctor cleaned off the afterbirth
I kicked a verse, smoked a blunt, shooked the Earth
Smacked the physician, and fucked the nurse
The truth hurts, like a sword in the hand of this expert
Cuttin through your soul, like your best friend did your dirt
Mental like physical blows destroy ego's
Your style is Babylonian, like dicks in assholes
The drama unfolds, don't mean nothing up my nose
I can't stand snow, it only blows like nitro
Blistering, my flows I'm splittin, so I hope you listening
Super shoutout to all my niggas in prison
Shout to the pyramids, the cypher and scription
Science fact not fiction, I cut with precision
Speak multiplication, subration, addition
Division, Great Solar Stance burns compition
""This-this-this-this is the Showdown""

I put you in the chicken wing like Bob Backlund
Jack ya team captain
Bring drama like summer night, ghetto action
Some honies got it twisted, fat asses I mash 'em
Cops like jewels, back in the days I snatch 'em
You catch a tantrum, date how the raws rockin' the drum
Float like the white lotus, kill like Whitey in Vietnam
You should peel arm, 
gorilla tactics like Viacom
Set shit on fire like a bong, up in smoke like Cheech & Chong
True blacks too strong can't let nothin stand in my way
Shit will get thick like Juice 60 in Friday
In Brooklyn, kill MC's like Captain Hook your children
To rappers I'm a villain, fill esteem wan't my secret like Samson
Picture so hard, I stunt your grandson son
Teleport from 
Coast To Coast like Spaceghost
Like soy butter on my breakfast toast
And when It comes to makin it nasty, I flips it the most
""This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown""
""This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown""

Setting it off like pistols in the projects
The climax hold ya six like nasty hot wet sex
But string tech I catch wreck, ejucalate when I inject
Not a player hatter, regulator, trick niggas get checked
When I resurrect hip hop, you know the bullshit stop
Like you got the oo-wop, the pops and what nots
Fruity like Ed Koch, ya straight boo-tops, I'm top notch
Super funky like a derelict prostitute prop
Ya hear gun shots, the coroner shows up to take flicks
Shit is feet, but no feet shit like chicks with dicks
Ya throat flip too quick, to blaze magnetic
Paramedics roll up on the scene
It's tragic, don't deal with Magic
Johnson, renegade like Charles Bronson
Packing a force like 18 Bronzemen

What a Day,Heroz4Hire,1999,"Woke up this morning had a spliff for breakfast
Slept good cuz the toast wasn't under the matress
Hop up in the shower, give my honie a kiss
I'm thinkin, I wish, everyday start like this
Turn on the news, starvin kids got nuff food to eat
And words of truth, put shoes on their feet
Usef Hawkings, still walkin the streets
Rodney King's a millionaire, but he ain't get his ass beat
Tiwanna Brodley gets justice
The Panthers thick as ever causing ruckus
No such thing as those Klan motherfuckers
Black sisters are treated like queens, not
Chickenheads cluckers
Black men are respected and not treated like suckers
Mike Tyson still a champ, bullshit don't get no airplay
I feel good, what can I see
""Day, what a day""-- Erykah Badu (4X)
	""I got to say it was good day""-- Ice Cube
Step out the door, sunshine hit my grill
Even Lee divide a mil, so niggas don't have to kill
It's all peace and love so people do what they wanna
Bumpin to Biggie and Pac, smokin a piece right on the corner
No crack babbies, or unwanted pregnacies
An apple a days the cure for any disease
And ain't no police and no felonies
Bill Clinton smoke crack not Marrion Barry
O.J. keeps his dough, Mumiet is let go
Divine Brown da movie star, Hugh Grant is the ho
Put the card in the ATM and it spit out mad dough
Gave it to an old lady, cuz I always get more
Just livin make me feel good, what can I say, but
""Day, what a day""-- Erykah Badu (4X)
	""I got to say it was a good day""-- Ice Cube
90 degrees in the shade, but it don't feel that hot
Giuliani get shot, baby open my favorite spot
There's a party tonight, guess who DJing Scott LeRock
And he's only spinning that real hip hop
Don't be late bop, eleven on the dot, honies flot
It's more dips then dicks, and nobody get shot
Stay here a little minute, then go harvest my crop
By the moonlight, get lifted and call it a night
But first I bump in this princess named Shaniqua Albright
She was lookin mad right, and her body was mad tight
Total control of my will, she couldn't put up a fight
She said if you wan't me take, cuz I have an early flight
Wiffie's waitin up, so I let her go on her way
But when I got home, my shortie said...

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, all the way

The first verse, perfect design conquest your desert thirst
Highly blessed, can't recept the evil luers curse
From the mansion to the slums, where the evil luers lurk
My life's work, want it so bad it hurts
I see through your facade like nipples through wet shirt
Mic experts, manipulate out thru the universe
Bitches wit dicks, reveal how niggas livin in skirts
Perverts, I put to death and throw to hell head first
My word is plated gold, isin't equal the work
Mental birth can show signs of movin Heaven and Earth
Never deal or take car, wear your heart in your dirt
Rhymes baptised in fire and never been burnt
Chorus
{Miz Marvel}
As I flex, on the set we ghetto intellect
My minds def, twice that of an all time vet
Quietest cat, rock around with no concept
Hit the L start choking and sleep with one eye open
You can try me, until I can get under your skin like poison ivy
Words invincible, hit it strictly for the pledgin principal
Continual, pen is like my sword I feel the armor
Hypnotic melodies, never gympsy steak charmer
Hearts is eye, blaze a stronger than a marijuana
You think I'm done, no, got dot.comma
My persona, change your heart to ghetto primadonnas
With maddic overdose like that guy from Nirvana
Time was cut short, like a fair weather friend
But if they gone, then I don't need them
Can I get an amen

Cast a spell, on all non believing inphadeles
Heroz4Hire, exclusive list the clientele
Make your head swell, legal spinning like a carosel
Sweet as caramel, transform into Miz Marvel
Queen lady of the Supahaman Klik Cartel
If I need a bonecrusher, call up on the sun toucher
In camouflage, gone just like a desert mirage
Try to escape the fate, safe in proper sabotage
Lyrical massage, sounded like comitcally shape
My verbal swordplay, bounces off the walls like richochets
Compete, with the style that you know your couldn't beat
And I call you niggas pussy, cuz you are what you eat

Hold Tight,Still Rising,2007,"I can't sleep at night plus my chest feels tight
Things seem to be the worst theyve ever been in my life
Im slipping in the darkness and im searching for light
Plus the agents of satan try to silence my mic
Its the demons within nowadays that i fight
I took a few steps back, will i ever reach the heights
It'll be nice to have kids and a wife
But i tend to do whats wrong even though i know whats right
Got a DWI, i ??
Contemplating sellin that stuff they burn in blunts and pipes
Unholy thoughts cause me stress and strife
Although im tired im determined to fight the good fight
I exist in a world thats more than black and white
Its like that space and time where day transitions the night
Hear if you master yourself you get general stripes
Just dont tempt the wolves because the beats bites
(chorus)
(...)
(chorus)
I feel im at a crossroad, i ask myself whats next
I got a monkey on my back and hes addicted to sex
Things were simple as a child, but now theyre so complex
Should i, sell my soul to collect fatter checks?
I know how to play my cards but im playin with fixed decks
When i want to ease my mind i read ancient texts
Tryna occupy my time with different projects
And when all else fails the deuce-deuce are backs
Where im at now in my journey, trust i didn't expect
When theres a flaw in your design you blame the architect
Had the best intention, but wasn't living correct
And day by day tighten the noose around my neck
Look at myself in the mirror and get vexed
And i constantly ponder which course to select
Now my sorrows are (?) and get wet
But i won't go out like the gunman at virginia tech

It's the sinister sister, leave mics so hot make hands blister
Try to catch me but all you heard was ""Damn you just missed her""
Daily means and whereabouts, more secret than a whisper
Cut sharper than a scissor, lookin' for the love elixir
Like most listeners, let them know it's all in they reach
Spittin' my verbal attack with the impeccable speech
How 'bout niggas, gotta keep your dog on a short leesh
Got 'head speak, If not they try to play us like suckas
The most commitment, wanted non commitment givin' mothafuckas
Not sayin' that all men fall in this category
But one look in his eyes and I can tell they whole story
Lookin' for a friend or wife for late nate creep if he's horny
If he's sincere, got G, or pick up lines that corny
Tryin' to say that he adore me, when he don't even know me
That type of weak game will leave a nigga, poor broke & lonely
Willin' to go and stick anything that let's em stick 'em
Cuz thru all that bullshit, he's lookin for anotha victim

Perfect example, it was like Monday the 10th
Late afternoon, just on my king and it was time well spent
In any event, this niggas eyein me, it's evident
Try hard to cement, to ignore his twisted compliments
He seem hell bent for my time, a hundred percent
Asked to come to sit at my table, if I was the age of contended
And no why he would put himself thru such torment
And despite the corny line, you could see the extent
That he would go, said he'd pay my rent, dress me and give me dough
Followed by constant comments 'bout my bodies measurements
I said ""I don't drink moet, take loot to get bent
Or use niggas to pay rent, I'm independent""
His response that ""You heaven sent
But I haven't met a chick that ain't have a price yet""
I said ""Well, I must be a different type of female
While bitches waitin' to exhale, I plot schemes to black male
Talkin' 'bout, you wash your car, who you knew and your wealth""
A new expirement, thinkin this niggas playin' himself
With just his arogance, not to exclude his rude attitude
How he pursued, relentless references to seein' me nude
The wrong move, this jiggy nigga really thinks he's smooth
Like he got somethin' to prove, and I got nothin' to lose
I know his style, never ran into a femme fatale
Like you hearin' right now, comin' thru ya ear canal
I smile politely, so as not to blow my cover
Carryin' on conversation, knowin' that I'm on some other shit
Should have stopped when he had the chance to quit
Talkin' about his income, and how 'bout he wanna get some
Next time we meet, he'll just be the next victim

But she'd only fuck with niggas if they had mad loot

Queens,Divine Design,2003,"Shinin' star but not a movie actress
Mind refined, skintone many shades of blackness
And every man wanna have this, because she's the baddest
And her booty it got the fatness
Many come with excess bagage from broken homes
To heal her dome I wrote these poems
And most love to talk on the phone
The real ones they either love you or they leave you alone
Act childish even though they fullgrown
Some jump badge you gotta be like: shorty watch ya tone
Causin' commotion cause the species deal with emotion
No matter how dope they are they put you through the motion
Some move real fast and others in slow motion
The ones that's upset they have they granny fix some love potion
Some love flowers most smell like baby lotion
Some so ill they have a player talkin' love and devotion
The ones that been done wrong watch how you approach 'em
And save those phoney lines they can tell if you genuine
No matter how un-coachable I can coach you
I need to form my team...my black queen

Not ""The bitches""

Mother of mankind body a shrine black sunshine
God's most exquisit design wish they all were mine
The way she walk get me caught up everytime
Damn honey mad fine on some Sade shit is it a crime
The way she shake doubletape makes you break ya neck
Women little or nothing talkin' about she want respect
You gettin' weak she eat you up and gingerly step
But if it's tight then you just might get her in check
But come correct and don't have the wrong one have ya baby
Ask her how many niggas she want she'll probably say three
Some love to love you some love to spend money
I'm crazy tight with my loot but she can get all my honey
My man doin' life behind ears and that ain't funny
And the sky is the limit if they find themselves a dummy
Most like exquisit gear but they crib look mad bummy
Believe in T.V. with no concept of reality..my black queen


Ancient universal symbol of fertility, black soil
Wicked royal and loyal her skin mask moves from baby oil
She makes my temper boil I'm bound of her duty
Whether she got a real fat, or real flat booty
Due love the now man woman and child she makes me smile
All those show her conference try to copy her style
Mothers watch my sisters and nieces
As I grow older my respect for her increases
If she a ho I scoop up and teach her like Jesus
My excistance without her is meaningless
My goal is more than to get her undressed
I mentally caress this godess, pittoresque the nubian princess
See I once called her a bitch but she is a empress
And I can't live without her this I must confess
And thought sometimes she fills my life with stress
Nevertheless I love her to death...my black queen",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-queens-lyrics

This goes out to all my young brothers and sisters
Hold ya head, things ain't always what they seem
I'm about to give you a dose of reality
Real deal
{Jeru The Damaja}
Nowaways, records are played and superstars are made
Still mothers in the ghetto, rent dont get payed
As a result, bullets are sprayed and their sons are laid
It's no myth, in ghetto life, if you don't fight you fade
Surviving in the streets, not a task for ordinary men
Growing up in the hood, young black and supahuman
Caught up in the game of blocks and cops run your block
Intercourse with witches and hunted by warlocks
For props, boos-hoot pop, another brother drops
He barely knew his pops
Now his little seed will barely know his pops
Tunnel vision like a cyclops
I give you x-ray vision with these supahuman eyedrops
My niggas in the ghetto, give it everything you got
Cuz until we reach the top, can't stop and won't stop
Chorus 2X:
Can you feel?
The presha, the the the presha
Hand over
The presha, the the the presha
{Jeru The Damaja}
Journalists write articles cuz they can't write rhymes
Ever since I was a youth I dealt in crime
Now I'm trying to reach the youth, to preserve what's left
There's a fork in the road, choose life or death
There's too much stress, too many bullets for your vest
Temptress, suck ya best, exotic strains of syphillis
The rest, rest in the Earth, only the best progress
It's you who think I see commercial success
Warning, this shit is real, this is not a test
And what I express worth more than a Lexus
Serve it like baby food, still hard to digest
Long ass niggas is mental slaves, I gotta protest
Chorus 2X
{Jeru The Damaja}
Baby in the crib, and dad got no loot for food
So he do what he got to do
Keep it real, I don't playa hate ya
God my divine nature
Sent at this time to stabilize the structure
We should all live like wise kings
Now sing praise to the gutter
The blazed double X, concelead like a box cutter
Brothers should be teaching, not murdering one another
Word, to the mother land, kill the other man
Lord of the concrete jungle, and Tarzan was a black man
Swingin on vines vibin, been balancin the eco system
And since there's no more niggas in the ghetto, here I am

*Down the world is...*
{Jeru The Damaja}
This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Avoid jail legend, fingerprints on full metal
Jackets like design, so that you can't hack it
But you musn't get caught up in these devilish tactics
Never let the man pull ya string like Geppetto
The game's the same, boricua or moreno
Don't watch ya step and you be like, mi amigo
Forensics made the maps, so now he's on death row
Yo what's the steelo, real brothers do it on the d-low
Knowing's half the battle, so now you know
To be on point, cuz anybody can be a casualty
Some brothers lost there life, fuckin with O.P.P
Um robbery and P.C.P
From the cradle to the state penitentary
He'll be into the middle of next century
Ask me, is it crying S-H-A-M-E
You got to watch how you flow and you will grow
If not you get tripped up in the ghetto
Chorus 2X
This is for the youth blak luv
This is for the ghetto, blak luv, blak luv
{Jeru The Damaja}
This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Sellin yae yo, playin c-lo, duckin po-po
Some brothers got murdered over a kilo
5-0 ask questions, but nobody know
What's the M.O., another brother trying to get dough
Be careful how you live, cuz that's how you go
Wild like Rambo, get shot down by the Commando
Call your co-defendent sing like D'Angelo
No problemo, but upstate you sing soprano
Police sadimize, a man at the 7-0
Be careful where you go yo, and just in case you ain't know
I flow, to liberate the ghetto
Chorus 4X
{Jeru The Damaja}
This is to my brothers and sisters in the ghetto
Trying to be like Pablo, DeNiro, Al Pacino
You be all right until you run up on Columbo
Get caught red handed, so you got to go
You lose the crib, the car, the women and the dough
This can't be happenin so you like ""Oh No""
So avoid this fate, and absorb the conscious flow
This is not a demo, strictly for the ghetto
Not the limo, work for the pimp, hustler and the ho
And I'm gonna let you know
Whether you as black as jack or brown as nino
Blak Luv, is what we need to flow
From the ghetto

Renegade Slave,Heroz4Hire,1999,"Too escape the Devil's jaws & prepare for the final wars
So when we strike, it's multiple wounds like boss mind thoughts
To breakin these laws, I'm thinkin because I tap jaws
Burn down broncos and teach ya whores to fight for the cause
The beast roars, I don't drink, I'm takin heads like the moors
I keep it, jungle naughty, ya put a razor to yours
That's crazy fake like house niggas rockin bikini drawers
In a pituat force, puttin bombs at Devil's doors
Black Diamond, the numerous flaws, blood pours
Doin it, feel nigga style, for dreams that died on prison floors
Liberate, carnivores that dine on walls
And I be fighting even after I reach African shores
The Renegade Slave
[Field nigga, trained in guerilla
Warfare, makin it real nigga] 
Weaks lions, surrender their crowns, avoid the battle ground
I storm the plantation, take masa head and burn his house down
Home bound, pitch black, don't make a sound
Renegade Slave flippin, fire a rip thru your town
Satin heart pound, whose to smile, now we frown
How slaves run around like clowns holding whitey down
No more whippin and riggin, I'm shootin plansmen, hit the ground
So much blood on the seed, no's left, face down drown
Listen, close, cuz the meaning is profound
The beats is on my hills, I boogie like James Brown
Keep a low pro, communicate underground
Cuz no devil alive can scan my sound
The Renegade Slave

Warfare, makin it real nigga]
[Field nigga, trained in guerilla
Warfare, makin it real nigga]
[Field nigga, trained in guerilla
Warfare, makin it real nigga] 
Smarter then Frederick Douglas, and wilder then Ike Turner
My will to be free, in your eyes makes me a murderer
Creepin late night like a burglar, Study his literature
When the kings rise again, bells of Bob knows the procedure
Uncle Tom, shot on the spot, we don't need ya
I know who I am, a warrior like Kunta
But not running away, runnin demons into the caves
Beware, beware, beware, the Renegade Slave
Hittin 'em from every angle, Devil's we strangle
And intangle in the web, when we rise again
The Renegade Slave's are comin

That's right, you know me
Don't act like you don't, you see me
You know where I'm at, you see when I'm comin
But you really don't know, you think you do
You never will, But I'm always here
And I will rise again, You can't hold me down
You can't do it, I won't allow it to happen
My will is too strong, I can't be broken

Point Blank,The Hammer,2014.0,"I wanna speak to you
I wanna speak to you
You're concerned about the fate of the human race

Look up in the sky
Its not a pimp but it's the black flint
Intelligent as fuck, but dirty like the US government
Ya'll tryna live like rappers
But you get none of the benefits
They using BET and shit
To keep y'all niggas ignorant
I heard they (?) that said that I'm irrelevant
The devil been real busy
Cause now narcissists the dominant
The way these niggas act
Man, prison is the consequence
This rap shit's an illusion like the black president
Damn
That's a bad bitch
Today, that shit a compliment
Instead of gettin' smarter
Youth today are less articulate
They drainin' our intelligence and hip-hop's the instrument
I have a sense of duty, so a brother here to circumvent
Blind leading blind man
You think that's a coincidence?
These cats committin' crimes
And I'm here to present the evidence
Word to God, this shit is sickenin'
Rapping used to be hard but now its so effeminate
(Your days are numbered)
Who 'dat on the mic
Doin' work?
Yo its the black Kirk
Incredible as fuck how they manipulate your mind like church
Niggas on these records talkin' 'bout how their team put in work
Fuckin' with these shorty's heads because they never did no dirt
Fuck around with body guards 'cause they're scared to get hurt
They claim they livin' dangerous, but strictly safety first
Yo
I keep it gully, fuck if your bubble burst
All that killer monologue, but you on stage in a skirt
By now I thought it'd be better, but it's just getting worse
Cause shit they spit is the opposite of quality first
'Member when the game used to be diverse?
Now almost every single record one repetitive verse
I'm about to drop a bomb and watch 'em all disperse
'Bout to go berserk until the trends reversed
So all y'all metrosexuals hold on to your purse

Mic twisted overseas with a breeze
Best believe double fisting please
Cover the ears of your seeds

To some I'm trouble
Double bubbles call me king's horrific
Load up linguistics, the ruler of rhythmic

When I chump your style on general principle
Build spiritual
Shorty wobble, doubt make you physical
Put fire to the mic
Till it secrete crazy chemicals
The way I murder mics is criminal
And if you press up dog, you messed up
You gon' need dental work
Agonizing pain, cause the truth hurts
On a plane getting brain
With my hand up her skirt
For that last line
You'll probably think I'm a jerk
But can't deny that I'm fly
On the mic put in work
Drop a bomb make emcees disperse
This shit wicked
Like Klan members bombing a church

Beans with the rice and
Fiends screaming my shit

Out semen

I get cash wired
And I blast iron
Through cast iron
Its the vampire
I suck the air out of your flat tire
You look tired
Nigga just retire
(You're fired!)
Before I chop you up like Benihana's
And have you stressed with a gray beard
Like Kenny Rogers
Fucker

I'm all for mathematics
You niggas Lenny Kravitz
Big Jew from New York
They call me Jacob Javitz
You a devil, every cell in me is Asiatic
I'm old school but don't you take me for no geriatric
Never catch me in a skirt wearing a heavy jacket
You fashion forward, I'm a poet slash scary black kid
Scary Jerry, extremely strong and very active
Real niggas know and love me
I'm a crazy bastard
Never hating, yet I'm always getting hated on
I'm too abrasive for the players with the gators
Women love me
They don't say its my amazing charm
They say I'm loving and generous as the day is long
But never pussy
Nigga push me, I'ma break his arm
Counter-punching, every move you make is wrong
Bullied brother uplift and celebrate the strong
Now go get your fucking shine box (?)

Not Tha Average,UnKnown,1996.0,"I met this honey named Yolanda
You would not believe the things that I told her
She had potential so I thought that I would mold her
(Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her (?enem?) was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said ""Mi casa es su casa""
Meet me at my pad tomorrow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says ""What's that?""
I said ""Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for""
She says ""Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw""
And I said
I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga
I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
No, no I'm not your average nigga
(Yo Ru! Yo these honeys be on some shit for real. Yo tell me about the
Other honey you was kickin' it to)

I met this honey named Tamika
My intentions was more than just to freak her
Since I'm gone I thought that I would teach her
(Where'd you meet her at, black?)
At The Tunnel so you know it didn't happen like that
I got her name and her number
I said ""Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?"" She said ""Uh-uh
But you got the digits-ring me up tomorow and see where it leaves ya at
We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting
She said ""Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I got mad respect""
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said ""You know Tamika?"" He said ""Yeah I know the whore""
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo
I'm not your average nigga
You see, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga
I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know I'm not your average nigga
(scratch-""Chain nigga""-scratch-""here you comin' but your steps are to loud
Standing on the corner, thought him was cool""-scratch-""chain nigga"")

I met this honey named Sabrina
I thought that this time this one would be the Queen of
My dreams, but you know how that goes
(God, I heard it before)
So let me tell you what happened one day I'm outside her door
And we're talking about how her ex-boyfriend be stalking
She said she thought she saw him when we were walking
I said ""Don't worry about it
Put that shit on the side, and slide up in the crib""
So we're lampin', she's still shook up about what happened
I said ""Don't sweat it, he's probably just rappin'""
She said ""Little do you know
Last week he threw a brick threw my bedroom window""
I said ""Whatever, I don't think he's that crazy""
She said ""You never, know where he may be""
All of a sudden, out of nowhere
The crazy mothafucka jumped out on me
I made him melt with a blow to the head
And before I bounced, this is what I said
I said
Yo I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga
Mista, I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know, I'm not your average nigga",https://genius.com/Jeru-the-damaja-not-tha-average-lyrics

Smellin' straight like ass, sticky shit on the floor, word
Bums rush the car in orange vest and hats
Mad trash on the tracks, bigger than cats
Niggas is mean muggin' for some like, yo, they buggin'
But I know they all drunk, so we don't mean nothin'
Po-Po jump on to deep lookin' noy
Thinkin' 'bout the situations that they hope to aviod
Lookin' shorty in the cut, big butt and all wobbly
Fuck around and get burnt like thrid degree

Everybody reps the team, it's either Knicks, Mets or Yanks
Long Island for white stanks, central Brooklyn still stinks
Guidos hit the club in the city with they bitch
Gettin' drunk out they mind, startin' fights and shit
Crackheads beg for dope, but they be holdin' bricks
Hunts Point got pimps, hoes and dumb tricks
 blow that dro
And get some Henny in them and they turn into nymphos
Stick up kids and hustlin' pros
The Deuce is filled with tourists, undercover Five-O
Bright lights on big buildings,  national day
Run aways and port authority, the bathrooms smell horribly
Mass transit, one, two and three
Ain't no other city in the world compares to NYC
But I ain't gotta tell ya that, I think y'all know
Here's my stop, I'm off to the studio

New York, it's the city of schemes

Super solar strength plus high intelligence
I dedicate my life to hunting down ignorance
I'll never call him mister
Kidnapped his bitch sisters
Seduction and lust
Force fed ‘em jewels now they roll with us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I won't stop until this devil evil empire is crushed
Rich men I annihilate 'em
And escape with no abrasions
I did not kneel but could not steel to Temptation
So now I'm hated by the family
Took the head of his brother Pain and toruted his cousin Agony
Killed his wife Spite and burnt up his baby
Their demise was a thrill
Each kill got more fun to me
I know tha Prophet thinks I'm going crazy
Live by it die by it
Can't a damn thing stop me
I'm Rasta Powers
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
Can't a damn thing stop me

I kill the lowman on the totem pole up to the high commander
I fight for Truth and Right
And could care less about a bystander
Old ladies and babies get hit in cross fire
Like when I gunned down Desire
And  The empire
She said she heard I was a gun for hire
I didn't know her
So I checked her for weapons and wires
Something's wrong
Still I let her go on
She said she wanted someone gone
Ignorance and he's down at Hoyt and Schermerhorn
In tha building by tha train station
My 7th sense went buckwild when I heard the location
She hasn't noticed I had come to the realization
It was a setup
So I pulled out my joint and shot the bitch up
I'm Rasta Powers
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
Can't a damn thing stop me
Ya white Superman
Ignorance is cunnin'
But I'm constantly gunnin'
Wielding my blades into a fate
And cuttin' down his evil minions
Assassinate the captains of his legions
I was once overwhelmed Despair and Depression
They thought they had a nigga
Said I'd die by decapitation
Let off sonic, electromagnetic, radiation, vibration, smokescreen
No more Rasta Powers
Breakout regroup their dead in 24 hours
Their demise was a thrill to me
Every shot every kill became more fun to me
I know tha Prophet thinks I'm going crazy
Live by it die by it

 the combat, I catch wreck hood-a
Not a drug fanatic, still I stay charged on Buddha
Since the last dope, I guess I'm a dope shoot-a, root-a, toot-a
But not a cowboy, a wild-wild boy
You want mic wreck, then check the real McCoy
I'm slaying suckers like hat vills the fat MAC kills
With the rap skills, heat wheels like coal steel
I don't need a Glock, cause I sling-sling in my slingshot
Skills come down like waters and blow up the spot
A legend in my own timing, steadily climbing... ah FUCK IT!
I'm the God of rhyming

Jeru!

D-A, M-A, J-A, slay-A
Punk nigga on the spot as I rock this way
Broke pump from jumps so all you crabs know the flave
I'm ripping up the tracks like the back a slaves
The masses are amazed by the way I flips it
Psycho-kinetic energy manipulates it
So when snake stepped up for the 12 round-bout
Like Tyson from Brooklyn, one round I put 'em out
Science is the tool I use like a mechanic
So rhymes are dope, mechanically-incline

Master of the sun, moon and stars are shining...

Fucked up for life, slick you shouldn't have gambled
Rhymes are , the hardcore hoodlum
I get wreck, respect and then some
Some say weak glances and sucker advances
Go scratch by your nuts, since your life taking chances
I'm here to put you on, in case you didn't know
You could get clapped in the gat, by the MAC one-O
Favorites that's shown, I flip a bother on crack-a
I be the hijacker maniac Bushwacka!
Heard many tales about the land of Compton
But I don't give a fuck cause Brooklyn bothers stomping
Combine line from the top of my head
Smoke stupid sess and my pops is a dread
Don't have a ride so I  junction
I'm not a chump, don't make a chump assumption

It's of a higher order, a higher design
A divine design

Divine design, design's the rhyme
My brother standin' on the corner, straight stranded in time
'Cause favorite MC's makin' records that perpetuate crime
Babies, is havin' babies, stick-up kids is goin' crazy
Stray dogs is in the street, watch that one he got the rabies
Had to knock this nigga out because he tried to play me
No phone in my home, dog, what the fuck you lookin' at?
Sha came home from prison, and quickly relapsed
Black-on-black's got that nigga for his chain on the train
The shots, wasn't fatal but they damaged his brain
Cocaine, numb the pain like Nova
I'ma do him for his ID and now it's all over
Champagne wishes, on a four-leaf clover
Livin' up, in the hood and pushin' a Range Rover
Shorty bootylicious but you pay for her affection
Pimpin' told her this would get her up out of the 8 Section
Nana in church, celebratin' Christ's resurrection
Poogie shot too much dope, he got that HIV infection
Cops serve and protect them, for us there's no protection
Guns and drugs and unnatural selection
 brothers think it's still all good
I guess they just caught up in the hood...

Where you at?
Has crossed my mind
Where you at?
Has crossed my mind

Divine design protects the blind
The Twin Towers fallin' down, another sign of the times
The masses embracin' ideas that confine the mind
Little girls think they grown ladies, what have you done for me lately?
Alcoholics in the street, watch that one I think he crazy
Had to bust off my gun 'cause shorty tried to blaze me
Little kids on my block whylin' out, because they lack the fact
Rae got 5 to 10 for sellin' DT crack
The dopeman stacks, don't hate the player, hate the game
Feds harass drug dealers while terrorists hijack planes
Maintain, hard times is almost over
The summer heat make the streets explode like supernovas
Battle scars, tattoo street soldiers
The pen make, heathen men seek Allah or Jehovah
Son's mad thugged out, prime candidate for correction
Leave MC's with no dad, he rocks no hats when he's sexin'
When he get that life term, somebody test him
Solitary, confinement - it's too late for reflection
Cops serve and protect them, for us there's no protection
Guns and drugs and unnatural selection
 brothers think it's still all good
I guess they just caught up in the hood...

Where you at?
Has crossed my mind
Where you at?
Has crossed my mind

Divine design ensures that I'll shine
The truth - a double-edged sword that can sever your spine
My mental spray like a Mac before I clap like a nine
The young black man's angry, ain't no if, ands, or maybes
85's in the street, runnin' round in mental slavery
Got beef wit the beast, he always tryna lace me
Po-po all up in the hood like a gang, what the fuck is that?
So-called crooks, get shot in they back
Fake niggas react, but make they moves just for fame
From activist, to poli-tic-ian
Hu-mane, the tongue they speak when sober
Power-drunk, they wicked like the last day in October
Snakes in the grass, here comes the lawn mower
Pork chops, crack and piss, what a terrible odor
John Taliban got the complexion for the connection
Where I come from youth grow up day to day with no direction
Cops serve and protect them, for us there's no protection
Guns and drugs and unnatural selection
 brothers think it's still all good
I guess they just caught up in the hood...
