Dollaz + Sense,Safe + Sound,1994.0,"Now let's get down to business, bitches!
'Cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin' to diss this
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Nine, ten—Eiht, you can't win
'Cause all the way around, nigga, I gets respect
And you's a nigga that can't even get no props in yo' set
Tragniew Park you say, huh?
Wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin'
So listen close, 'cause I don't want y'all to miss
That I'm 'bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
Acacia, Poplar, Maple, Spruce, Cedar, Elm
Westside Trees sprayin' all the fleas
That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders
(So niggas watch yo' ass at that center divider *gun blast*)
Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame
When I caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game
You looked up and you seen my niggas comin'
And you looked like yo' bitch-ass was 'bout to start runnin'
But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation
(Yo, whatup?) And see if we can fix this little situation
But would I fuck you up was what you wondered
Yeah, that's probably why you
Changed your little pager number (punk-ass!)
But bitches like you don't grow
You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
And callin' me skinny, you's a clown
I'ma call you Theo 'cause you weigh 92.3 pounds
Wack-ass actor, movie script killer
Fool, don't you know? Quik is still the nigga
Compton psycho, boy, you oughta quit
Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
You need to stay down, you Compton clown
And get off of the nuts of the niggas with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'ma boot yo' mothafuckin' ass to the Moon
You need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the C-P-T
No, better yet T-T-P, or the niggas that look up to me
I make it my business to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever, well, that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand
That there's only one DJ Q-U-I-K
With no C still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and
Depositin fat checks and
Gettin' mad sex while I floss the NSX and
Doin' what I wanna, and you's a goner, nigga
For thinkin' that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin' 'nac with all my niggas 'cause it's to the good
So don't knock it 'til you try it
'Cause Eiht, he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
So put the P in it, represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa
Let me take a load off my scrotum, little pest
If it don't make dollars, nigga, you know the rest

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie-ass niggas keep on ridin' the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik
Ain't your average everyday motherfucker (hah)
Slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon' be the first, you little trick-ass ho
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck
'Cause when I caught yo' ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence you left speedin'
You ain't no fuckin' killer, you's a comedian, beyotch!
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin' your set a bad name with your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue?
Yeah, you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin' on the Westside
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side
Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a real killer
Tell me, did you feel a little nervous? (hell yeah)
You was in the shadow of death
With two trey-five-sevens pointed at your chest
Hmm, whatchu gon' do? Where was your niggas that kill at
You ain't got no killers, so kill dat!
Holdin' up your hands and beggin for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
I'm through playing wit'cho punk ass
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Shouts goes out to my well-known road dog
What's up Donzelle Tru?
They don't understand it, baby, they can't fade us out here on these Compton streets (beyotch!)
It's bigger than they can imagine
To the whole entire Death Row family
Both sides, whassup, niggas?
And my nigga big Suge, known for keepin' shit poppin'
To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-C, little straight G
And that little singin'-ass nigga Danny Boy
Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this
I'm the first nigga that was ""Bangin on Wax""
Yeah, if you remember, 1987 underground tapes
And it don't stop, and it won't stop",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-dollaz-sense-lyrics
Tonite,Quik is the Name,1991.0,"Here we go
Yo

A day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the eight, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-ness
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear is in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook
And AMG is in the den reviewin' rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack
I pick up the phone and it's the D (Wassup, nigga?)
He said he's comin' down about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin'
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me daddy
Yo, open up the door 'cause here come Freak-man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the El-Co
And everybody's sippin on a quart (Here we go!)
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just bought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent

Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah)
Tonight
Tonight is the night
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yo, when we gone get bent?)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Aw yeah)

And now I'm out of the tub, I'm feelin' fancy free
Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin'
And I am steadily thinkin' about the eight that I'll be drinkin'
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Hamm is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
(It's the bomb!)
Yo, I can feel my senses (Gettin' numb!)
Yo, fuck the forty ounce (I need some rum!)
I'm chillin' like a villain (Here I come!)
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty
Proper Friday evening, and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps
(Yo what they in fo'?) A fin or a half
(Yo shoot that ten, nigga!) Don't make me laugh
Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin' niggas money

Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah, watch me bust a ho)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Passin' naturals on motherfuckers)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yo, I'm unfadeable)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (ahh, let's break it down, so I can get funky)
Tonight
Ahh yeah
Givin' em somethin they can roll on
Hold on

Wake up Saturday morning, and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
(Last night)
Soon as I felt it comin' on, I shoulda quit
It's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above to whom thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Callin' Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round, I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
And some fine ass bitches comin over at four
(I thought you wasn't drinkin no more) Yeah right
Because as soon as they come, we doin' the same ol' shit tonight

Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Straight gettin' fucked up, hey)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Fuck that pass me that piña colada man, I don't wanna fade that eight ball no mo')
Tonight
Tonight is the night (That shit be fuckin' a nigga up)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Aw yeah, nothin' but a party and I'm kickin' it)
Tonight (What's up Greedy Greg?)
Tonight is the night (How you livin?)

Heyyy, check it out..
DJ Quik is in the motherfuckin house! (x8)

Check it out..
Now I be knockin bitches like it ain't shit
Cause I'mma playa motherfucker named DJ Quik
Yo, maybe it's the way, I hold my dick
That makes all the girlies wanna ride my tip
But some of these bitches try to act unfair (why?)
Maybe its becuase my hair is longer than theirs
But I don't give a fuck, no I don't care
Because I'm like Noah's Ark - my bitches come in pairs
You see I'm 5'11"", my dick is size seven
And if a hooker's fine I can stretch to a nine
It goes deep (how deep?) All up in that shit
I'll fuck a pussy dry cuz I don't know how to quit
I'm 19 (say what?) so I'm a young ass man
My eyes are brown and my skin is tan
So pull them cotton-ass panties right down to ya knees
If you wanna take part in a proper-ass skeez
I'm more than a playa (word?) I'm more like a pimp (yeah!)
I love black pussy but I sure won't simp
I got the bitches on my jock like an airplane wing
And only way for me to get 'em off I have to sing
I say, ""Oooh ho, don't jock me so
Never-ever-ever wanna let me go
Once I whip this dick on you!""
Heyyy, check it out I say, ""Oooh ho, don't call me no mo'
How in the fuck can I let you know
That I'm a motherfuckin TRU!"" (Aww yeah, worrrd 'em up!)
Now that oughta tell ya right then and there
That I'm a true motherfucker so ya better beware
Cuz when we huggin and kissin, and ya wanna get mushy
Girl ya best be prepared to fuck because I love black pussy!
I can't help it cause I love black pussy..
I got to have it, just like a rabbit - black pussy..
Black pussy.. what kind?
{*Quik scratches ""Sweet, sweet, sweet.. sweet""*}

Yeah.. and I'm takin
All the money from these funky hoes that I be breakin
If you say that there's another Quik then you're mistaken
I amm not a coward and you'll never see me shakin
Never breakin lots of money that I'm makin
If you double-cross me then I'll be your undertaker
I will never be-friend you because you are a steaker
Open up your mouth if you want some beefsteak-ah
If you suck it long enough you'll taste a milkshake-uh
Lyrics I am hummin, when they see me comin
Suckers they... aww shit, hold up man
{*needle drags across the record*}
This the wrong motherfuckin page and shit
Aww shit, I need to start on the..
Oh okay, here we go:
{*music kicks back in*}
Black pussy! Always talkin bout it cuz I love it
Women get grown up just as soon as they let me rub it
And in a week's span, my homey Freak-Man
Sinks into so much pussy we should call him Quik-sand
(Last ho was done by the true motherfuckers
From the P-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E) Players Clique
Tweety's in the cold room, Freaky's in the studio room
I am in the livin room, and Hammer's in the bedroom
Freakin! (Or should I say skeezin?)
Call it livin large in 1990 becuase playin be the reason
So many freaks we have to forward the calls
And when the girlies hear the.. {*beeper goes off*}
.. they pause, and get hot (how come?)
I think they know what time it is
They should know that's how we handle our biz (gotta handle it)
They shouldn't trip and call playin a sin
Because it's in and we're all black men so we love black pussy!
And ya know that, because we show that!
Yeah..
Aww yeah!
Cuz DJ Quik is the king of the underground scene
Yeah
DJ Quik is in the motherfuckin house (say what?)
DJ Quik is in the motherfuckin house (say WHAT?)
And Shabby Doo is in the motherfuckin house (is that right?)
And Too E Caddy's in the motherfuckin house (aww yeah!)
And Playa Hamm is in the motherfuckin house (say what?)
And Donzelly's in the motherfuckin house (say WHAT?)

Safe + Sound,Safe + Sound,1995.0,"""
Quik, you're not a gangster, we're not
""

Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

Now I'm bout to take it back to '84, when I was 14
Kickin' back in the Trees, Westside if you please
And 436 West Spruce was the spot
With me Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug, and Rock
Donzelle, if you with me, just let that shit kick
If your head ain't spinning from dippin' all them sticks
'Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie
Screaming ""Órale ese"" with them laces on that Caddy
And you couldn't deny a hit from that Buddah Thai
Going 'round and 'round the driveway, now it's coming my way
And I'm zoned out, at a young age
And the whole Spruce Street was my stage
Peep, now back then I was in the 8th grade steady
But niggas my age was getting paid already
Yeah, like that nigga Zap, or even young Blue
They made they first million by the age of 22
Like Dan from Cedar block, him and little Motor
James from Piru Street with them boulders
Rest in peace little Noopy, he didn't have to brag
Rollin to the 10th grade in a fin-O rag
Well Goddamn, how can I be down?
I asked my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around
Nigga, they don't sell dope, it sells itself
While they kickback and just collect the wealth
And now I'm thinking...
Ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis
T-shirt dingy, Pro Wings tacky
This could be a way for me to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned
Right then is when I learned that...

Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

Peep, I gets a dub on the 1st and 15th for a fact
So instead of spending it up I gave my money to Jack
Now she jump in the rig and said 'I'll be right back'
When she came in she put me down with a plastic sack
I turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit
I'm keepin' my rocks in the house and not in my pocket
Sister Jackie's in the kitchen with some boiling water, baking soda, fresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders
Checking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks
Donzelly dippin' sticks, went and bought him a 6
And 500 block Peach running thangs ya see
Moving gallon after gallon and ki after ki
I'm telling you I done seen it all
From niggas hitting the sherm and then they pass out on the wall
From cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let their panties fall
Teeth rotten, hair gone, and whole checks get blown
But yet I'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam
Safety pin splitting rocks to the, um, tic toc
I went from wearing khakis to Sergio Tacchini
While my rocks are disappearing like the great Houdini
I bought a gang of clothes, all of my equipment
And getting something new with each and every shipment
Money gets made and money gets spent
And how these jealous niggas acting only makes it evident that...

Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

Check it, now in 1988 I moved away to L.A
My niggas Playa Hamm and Gina gave me a place to stay
On my way up from bottom rock
Bitches starting to jock
'Cause my hair is getting longer
And game's getting stronger
To pull my own weight, I went and got me a job
But by then, Hamm and Gina really started to squab
About whether I should go or stay
She told him 'Either he goes or you go'
We both was on our way
So he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning
Clowning with players all around me just astounding
My nigga Pimpin' Carl got us staring with that hair and
Rolling up and down the street in that rag 7 with Darren
Shabby Bleu feathered as he swerved
In the El Co, P7's park away from the curb
Big Jam, L.A Mike, Darryl, Nicky on the bike
That nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed
And hoes just come and go, in and out
Revolving door leaving with some nut in they mouth
I'm making a living off of pimpin' so you fools can't trip
'Cause even though I love God, I also love my grip

Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

Yeah motherfucker right back up on your ass
I hid in the bushes and I crept up through the grass
What you running for bitch, you fake Irish faggot?!
You got a big booty Everlast let me tag it
Cause you look like a woman but you try to clown
I kicked you in your ass that's why you jump around
So don't try to fuck with a Compton nigga
And I'mma tell you who's Daddy 'fore I pull the trigger
Now Daddy is the nigga getting head from your Mommy
Daddy is the nigga with the gun like a tommy
Daddy is the nigga that you wanna be like
And Daddy is the nigga with your shit on his Nikes

For when you diss a nigga that you won't be spared

No, you can't fuck with a nigga!

But you have to start to stepping you ain't got no style
Your white is showing like Belinda Carlyle
And the only way that you can be cool
Is if you jump your ass in the pool
Mr. Everlast went up to the Hill
To steal a style from the brother B-real
Then these no-talent fools out here getting breaks
Who the fuck better make these wack-ass tapes?
The homie said squash it and just let it slide
But I gotta shoot em down in the middle of the ride
I heard your head was big but I can still crush it
Every check you lay you know we have to flush it
Fuck it pass me the brew and let me swig a
Uhh it's the funky white nigga


The black fool from the other side
Watch me when I who-ride
Creeping up on you from the blind side
Now here we go ho yo niggas bring it on
Four dogs barking in a dawn
Hey watch em all, catch all your homies when they fall
Nothing but bullet holes left in the wall
K.K. tripping, never caught slipping
Throwing three fingers to the fools that's (crippin')
Say nigga don't you know what's up?
Coming up on to get you fucked up
Knuckle or the belt-buckle, which way you want it?
It really don't matter, I'mma be all up on it

It ain't no fun if I can't reroute your hoes in this direction
Swerve in the intersection, I'm done she restin
No question, done session
Home wreckin, Doc motherfuckin Dre no guessin
Nothin less than, I mess when I'm sexin
Bang on the block
Even Asian bitches like to bang cock
Draws drop, she bunny hops
On it like a pro, she comes out the clothes

But, uh, she flips the dildos
Whether in the Pumps, Nikes or the steel toes
Dre, you can spot it in the benzos
Squatin real low, got me drivin' real slow, she's a real hoe
And even though her parents spent the fat chip
On that private school tip
She graduated, got some thug dick and flipped
No more checkered sweater, vest and plaid skirts
She's out here naked more or less and that hurts
But she's in good hands, cause Suga Free palmin
He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh she okay she just runnin an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen
Bouncin through the mall, spottin 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him pattin his pocket and comin out his drawers
Layin his jacket on puddles, openin the doors
All for what?
Because I promised her my name gave her the game and still ain't fucked

Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me

(Don't trip) I'll keep it on a low, ahh

Now we just kickin back playin on some PS2
Contemplatin the game Dre and me best do
If you feelin froggies then leave when we test you
But I'm guaranteein you bitches leavin three less two
Never mind what that love and hate one pairs do
Y'all just snicker at that hooker when we all pass through
Dr. Dre and DJ Quik will probably outlast you
You're like see-trough pair of boxers nigga yo ass trough

Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue
Time of yo live, I got that boo
Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch
When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit
Wifey caught up me nigga
That's yo bitch, that's yo biz
That's show biz, that's how hoes is
With or without kids
Long as you keeping it on a hush she ridin dick
Ain't been satisfied in months, she's been fakin
That's why she callin me, guess what she's sayin

We can get drunk, have some fun and blow some smoke
(Come on baby) My spot is close, c'mon lets roll

You’z a Ganxta,Rhythm-al-ism,1998.0,"Siike! Oh no, it's '98 y'all and we got some new shit
What we say? Yes, ha-ha, fade the world in this motherfucker
That's right oh, check it out

Fuck what ya heard, baby, I'm DJ Quik
Whether on T.V. or in these streets, I'm still the shit
I went from drinkin' eight ball and makin' demos
To drinkin' Hennessey & Chivas Regal in the back of the limo
Gettin' my issue in life, you can't hate that
And when I tell you about yo' self nigga, you can't take that
Cause y'all be cross fadin' if you don't understand
You got a side and I got one but you be crossin'
Over here to see what's in my hand
Yeah but that's cool too I gets my money on the double
That's what I do hittin' them brown bubbles and avoidin' trouble
Hoes to choose with nothin' to lose
And a million mothafuckas wanna be in my shoes
But you don't understand, beyond the parties & cheer
I been broke my whole career breakin' bread with my peers
Bought a '96 Impala the new dubel SS
Before the 20,000 mile mark I gave it to sis'
I could never bust a new shoe if my nephews ain't got 'em
Fila Jumpman Cortez yeah I'm comin' out the pocket
For my homies in the 'hood up on it when I'm around
Cause there's a difference between bein' a thug & bein' down now

Bang bang boogie da bang da bang boogie to da
Boogie bang boogie da bang fuck what you sayin' nigga
You's a gangsta (No I'm not!)
You's a gangsta (No I'm not!)
Nigga, you's a gangsta!

Just cause I kick it with killers don't mean that I do it
My occupation's a musician and I'm stayin' true to it
I went from bein' a rider to bein' a provider
While I was straddlin' the fence tryin' not to hit the divider
Just an impressionable human being tryin' to do right
Every now & then I get my manhood tested in fights
Like I used to have a beef with this cat named Eiht
And his homies approached me at the club El Rey
What was I to do I'm on stage & I'm doin' my thang
And this nigga's out in the crowd tryin' to hoo' bang
Givin' it up for his homies & set trippin' too
But he wasn't from Rollin' 60's more like Tragnew
I wonder what's his problem what he tryin' to say
Is this business personal or just Fuck Quik Day?
I approached him like a man & not like a nut
He turned around and put his drink down and straight knuckled up
In the dark club punches is flyin' all around
And even though it was me & him the rumors went 'round
And said I killed somebody now how that sound
How could I stomp somebody to death that's bigger than me
And I'm just a hundred & fifty five pounds tell me


See some don't realize the power of lyrics
Cause when you rap about death you talkin' to spirits
You see you can say the things that can help us all ball
Or you can say things that make it bad for us all
Fix the problem the only way is come to the source
Don't be a Trojan Horse help us change the course
Everybody knows that it's bad in the 'hood
So check what you rappin' about if it ain't to the good
I did my part a long time ago I changed my views
Ain't no gang bangin' & slangin' just hangin' with trues
Give it up to my Creator 
& that you can quote
But mothafuckas still see me as a scapegoat
Yeah like that night when Biggie died at Quincy Jones spot
Like 400 other people yeah I heard some shots
Broke away with the crowd nervous obviously
& the mothafuckas blamed it on me
What the hell!?!


Check it out, this song is dedicated to the two most prolific writers in rap music history, 2Pac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. 
It's also dedicated to the little homie from 60's that lost his life at that party
, rest in peace y'all. 
And to MC Eiht when you get yo' head together maybe we can do a record, feel me? I'm out

Pitch In Ona Party,Balance & Options,1999.0,"Momma
I know you said that you wanted a record you could listen to
With no cussing and shit
I tried
But I still gotta do this

Yo
Jingle jingle
We've got the lingo
With so much heat, it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter cuz I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance
Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down, do or die niggas, don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't, want your bitch
Cause sorry ass women just, don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for air now
I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reefer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

And for sure
You've got yours
I've got mine's and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in ona party for sure

Alright
Somebody bring the potato salad
Let's take a ballot
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
Cuz we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing a gang of Jackie's chicken in they mouth
Anton & Sean pitching a fit
Cuz somebody rolled her bud in a henny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
500 dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
Cuz y'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that E&J and Paul Masson and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets


Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old raggedy ass bitches wanna come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw y'all raggedy asses' a party
And y'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush
Boy what else could go wrong?
Somebody kick the extension cord out

Move!
Y'all gotta be some of the clumsiest muthafuckas

To the sounds, now it's on
Y'all done fucked up
Get out, get on
Speed up nigga
Get up, take your weed on
Yea nigga, the drunk nigga said it
Your pockets, that's where I'm heading
Kick up",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-pitch-in-ona-party-lyrics
Do I Love Her,Balance & Options,2000.0,"(DJ Quik)
Lay there, please don't move baby
On me, don't you stop
Doggy, comin through baby
Watch me hit the spot
You make me wanna speak Spanish
You make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot
Strawberries soakin in amaretto out in the limo
Be spitty, got the car lookin pretty, in the window
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin my brain
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man
I can even make you feel me when you're usin your hand
I'm confident, like an MVP
Got the key to the CPT
Lookin for a G like me
She F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at?
True love only can be that
I'm tellin you that you the shit
Call me when you get this hit
(Chorus 1: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her? (Suga Free: nuh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no, no)
And should I treat her (no, no) like no other? (nah)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free
(Chorus 1: Suga Free)
Do I love her? (uh huh)
Do I need her? (Oh, yeah)
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
No I don't love her, (mmm hmm)
And I don't need her (Yeah, yeah)
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her
(verse 2)
See baby, I got a spot to fill
And all that callin me out my name gonna have you
Runnin down the street barefooted again sayin ""not for real!""
And how you gonna blame mine?
Dawon and Suga Free the same person
But you will never catch me and him in the same room at the same time
Baby, you not yo best, I called you
Cuz I was broke, hoeless, and short on these little ends
And it wasn't for no sex
I see you still messin wit yo phony ballers
But when they tired of you
You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin me for 20 dollars
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money
What? you stuck?
Ho, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet
But I'll give you a dirt rock
Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet
Baby wanna eat-eat?
Cuz Suga Free-Free
Will go gleek-gleek
And tweak-tweak
And put yo all to sleep-sleep
Ooh, I'm a tell (I'm a tell)
Suga Free pop a beat and spit a rap so swell
She said, ""suga free, you know anything about cars, honey?""
I said, yeah, you fill em up with hoes
Take em to the ho stro'
So they can get that money!
(Chorus 2: DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (suga free: uh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no way)
And do I treat her (no) like no other (man)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother suga free
(Chorus 2: Suga Free)
Aah, do I love her do I need her? (DJ Quik: Oh, yeah)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yea you do)
Do I love her? (mmm hmm) Do I need her? (fo sho)
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, Devil be gone! I'm leaving (yeah)
(DJ Quik, talking)
See, that's what y'all get for underestimatin me and Suga Free
We told y'all we was magical, way back in 1996
But y'all didn't feel that. Y'all chose to sleep on us
Baby, we so powerful, we can make the rain stop (Rain, ne me nome)
You feel that?
(Chorus 3: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her?
Do I take my money out and feed her?
And do I treat her (mmm mmm) like no other? (naw)
I don't know, I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free
(Chorus 3: Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, Do I need her? (DJ Quik: mmm hmm)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
Now do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her (you should)
You ne me nome, ne me nome, fore I lock you in that box again

Jus Lyke Compton,Way 2 Fonky,1992.0,"Finally out the muthafuckin' CPT
Off to other cities and shit
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs, a local nigga made good
I made a name off of making tapes for niggas in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin' and shootouts and bangin and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it
1991, it was double or nothing, not a nigga wit' hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggas and gettin' drunk and off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo' ass
Where you got blast, and now that's just a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand
We did a show up in Oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand
To them bangin' ain't nothin' new, and slangin' ain't nothin' new
And for every nigga we done shot, they done shot two
Straight doin' locs since the sixties, before I was born
Families of young niggas mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the Bay
Keep your hand on your clip
Because Oakland (
ha ha ha, is just like Compton
)
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland (
ha ha ha, is just like Compton, fool
)

Moving on to St. Louis, where they country as fuck
With gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a muthafucka, hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why I kept my ass on the bus
But later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends
Who put us up on the St. Louis cap
The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich
And a couple of bitches
Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store
He put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
'Cause later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin' and shootin' -- in Missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?
Now St. Louis (
ha ha ha, is just like Compton
)
Yeah y'all, St. Louis (
ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, nigga
)

I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin' that 
Colors
 and 
Boyz n the Hood
Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the 'Shaw
But now, back to the story that I'm tellin'
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started 
bailin'
When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits
When I'm thinkin' 'bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots
I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest
And San Antonio, was just waitin' to put us to the test
And before it was over the shit got deep
A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin'
Little did they know that we was packin'
Yeah, we was puttin' 'em down and scaring the rest, shit
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest
Now San Antonio (
ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton
)
Yeah, San Antonio (
ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, bitch
)

After about a month on the road
We came home and I can safely say
That L.A. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this
Have such a big influence on niggas so far away?
But still my story ain't over 'cause I got one more to tell
And the people of Colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show I did in Denver
With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink
Bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind
Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin' soda, and fuckin' up my Guess
When it was over two niggas needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches
Now Denver (
ha ha ha, is just like Compton
)
Yeah, y'all Denver (
ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, bitch
)
And you know that Oakland (
ha ha ha, is just like Compton
)
Yeah, y'all, St. Louis (
ha ha ha ha, we made it just like Compton, fool
)
Uh-huh, San Antonio (
ha ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton
)
Yeah, and Denver (
ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, punk ass niggas

Damn she fine... the way her body's movin'..

I popped the Perrier-Jouet, tryin' to get the two-way crackin'
Me and you back in the back of the back room
Actin' like you can't come back soon enough to do it rough, cause you a bluff
But I'm a winner, I could hold, watch your pretty legs fold
Stiletto to the metal, panties rose petal print
Pussy with a suttle scent, tryin' to get you double bent
And why the Oak-land, I'm the double stroke man
Sprinkle you with Gucci, rush, then I'll make your coochie bust

You ain't gotta ask, I'm a motherfuckin' mack and I always get my way
I wanna hit it from the back, wanna give that ass a smack
And I know you wanna taste it
I can tell by the way that she's starin', she wants to come home with me
She wanna sleep with me, she wanna play with me, she wanna lay with me
I can tell by the look in her eye when she pass by

Can't believe I might be likin' this chick
She might be somebody's wife in this bitch

But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle
(Damn she fine)
I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto
(the way her body's movin')
She got some meat on her bones
I love it that she takin' me home

I brought the first Puerto Rican here and put her in the club
But L.A. niggas won't give me props, they like scrubs
They love my ho while I fuck two more
Now they shorter than a commode, I watch the game corros'
She turnin' back to her toad, walkin' 'round the players club
Tryin' to bust him a load, drunk, blue balls and trippin'
Now they hittin' the road, staggerin', kissin' the wifey
But she know I'm this old, trickin' is so cold

Give me - one of those and one of those and one of these
Oh let me please bring these hoes to they knees
We can do this all day, we can do this our way
If you don't wanna play you can hit the highway
Attitudes and your clothes you can leave
Come in a trench coat with some weed
We can have a party like a fantasy
It all happened that day when she pass by

She got some meat on her bones
I love it that she takin' me home

It's DJ Q-U-I-C - my new name
Fresh breathe, drunk as fuck, smashin' on the shoe game
Then the other two came, sometimes pussy feel the same
How much should I pick?, this might be a trick
But which one kills the most, the gang bangin' or the gangbang?
If the bullets ain't rubber, playa it's all the same thang
Get you some money, pussy, and try to maintain
If you rich, keep Kim, don't pull no gun on that other bitch just to keep the trim
You trippin' - and keep her out the family car, put her in the stick
If she ain't BMW material, don't be milk in her cereal
If you get payed for it then you can play for it
As short as the tambourine rings and Nate sings
And T.I.'s on the other song sayin' the same thing
The MBZ, but the pussy is free
So let me fingerbang it with champagne before

Born and Raised in Compton,The Red Tape,1991.0,"Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm throwing down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin' a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doing nothing but (claiming my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doubling up and proving to suckers that I can throw em
I'm passing a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestyling, all the while still profiling
Never tricks, the DJ Quikster steals the show
So that's how I'm livin', I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
'Cause everybody knows you have to be stomping
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)
(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody must of wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clucker, now you're duckin', 'cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't going never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'CPT' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Kick it
(Born and raised)
Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up, nigga?
What's up KK?
My buddy D
We got AMG most definitely in the house
What's up Greedy Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin'
Talkin' about the Armstrong Pack
Straight got my muthafuckin' back
To my buddy NOE what's up, fool
Roche is in the house
My buddy Donzelle
You know what's happenin', fool
What's up, Inch?

I Don’t Wanna Party Wit U,Balance & Options,2000.0,"Well...check it out
I done found out that's there a fine line between being brilliant (uh-huh)
And being plum loco (oh fo' sho', hell yeah)

Get back, get forward, get raised, get lowered
Do some extreme shit, keep from being bored
Now it's double up, hoes come a nickel a dozen
They get hot and get fucked and don't remember from buzzin'
That's why you don't see me, I ain't at the club
I'm chillin' with my homies in the city of Hub
Because they needin' more than that ho (than that ho) the big fat ho
Tryin' to get every ballin' nigga in the saddle (yee-ha!)
Lap dance, fat chance, hot pants, you the man
Nowadays you can't tell, watch the crotch, it may swell
You needs a pap smear; you need to know
If you got an STD, some little critters in your trap, dear
Get on, me and my homies is indivisible
And don't floss money, looks better when it's invisible (yes)
We get props from Wall Street to y'all street
If ya missed it, I stay consistent (Why?) We got heat
C-P-T style, O-G me style
The D-J, Q-U-I-K with no C style
In yo' town, don't trip nigga, it goes down
And when you see me in all blue, you gon' frown
But I'm bridging the gap, I'm rigid with rap
Money or respect? Bitch, I'd rather have the digits than daps (tell 'em)
So give me the haps, do you want the meat or the scraps? (c'mon)
Put heat on my naps, and now my hair look sweet on my lap (always)
'Cause it's the same thang tryin' to kill the gangbang
Set examples for the kids, on how to maintain
Never be a lame brain; y'all ain't gotta feel the same pain
That put a nigga like me on the mainframe
Bow down, back up nigga, I'm hot now
And don't try to resuscitate me, when I'm shot down
Just call my homie Theo on the radio
And let him know his little homie Quiksta had to go
Because ""Gangsta, Gangsta,"" that's what they yellin'
But niggas do dirt, get caught, and start tellin' (shut up!)
Talkin' to you G's with no heart
We was throwin' and runnin' from bullets before gangsta rappin' was an art
Nigga (nigga), so don't test ya bulletproof vest (nah)
'Cause real niggas do real thangs up under stress
That's from the C-P-T, young G with heart, too
Oh, we still party, but now it's part II
And

I don't wanna party wit you.. hell naw
'Cause bitch you scary
You 20 years old, with 3 kids, 7 tattoos
You're bald, but your legs are hairy
I don't wanna party wit you.. hmm, hell naw
You need to put some lotion on
'Cause your skin is peeling around
Them bullet wounds on your back
You're fat, plus you're abortion-prone

I'd rather be a young exec, than the puppet on the other end
Dangling by a noose on his neck
They can't handle me, cause I'm where the {scandal} be
An underground nigga on Arista, now there is the family
That I'mma roll wit', take control wit'
Have a ball, break bread, and share the soul wit'
Even though I'm thirsty for money, in the worst way
I ain't go cry if I don't go platinum, on the first day
Watch me, get my hustle on with the friendly competition
Y'all got papers but I got the latest edition (extra extra)
A hundred-thousand dollars a track is what I crack
And if you ain't got that, keep wishin' (we all about it)
And to you bitch-ass niggas in the maze
Comin' at a player with {homosexual} ways
Keep lickin' on that other sound
And stay north of the 105 Hip Hop heads, 'cause this is underground
Yeah, right by the water, can't do right by ya daughter (no)
But look at all the shit that I done bought her (hmm?)
See lyrics ain't nothin' if the beat ain't crackin'
And these beats smackin', that's why the G's keep stackin', nigga

(I don't wanna party wit you).. hell naw
'Cause nigga youse a scuffla
Your braids is dingy, your clothes ain't got no creases
And your lips look like you sucked a muffler
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hell naw
'Cause bitch you didn't know me when you was fine as wine and thick
Now you're sick from smokin' that shit
You're broke and plus you're bony

W-E-S-T, C-O-A-S-T
That's where the hydroponic with no seeds be
So don't trip when you see me on the TV, or my CD
And my eyes are really R-E-D
See the {industry} is freak (shh shh shh), pardon me for bein' speaky
Snitchin' on y'all that wanna jeek me
What makes you even try that way?
Yeah, I might be fly, but I don't fly that way
Hmm, even on a gallon of Cisco I could never go disco
Dude, I ain't from {Frisco}
And to these bitches, y'all trippin', we ain't layin' wit' y'all
Just because we say we wanna fuck we playin' wit' y'all
This is entertainment, we tryin' to make us some change
We ain't impressed by what you got up under your Hanes
Bitch, that's yo' trap, and that's yo' sap
Let me spit the cap while she sit in yo' lap homie
Don't you know me? Jealous-ass niggas wanna flow me (Why?)
Just because your woman wanna blow me
On the strength I give that ho a tittie-toy
'Cause I'm the only ugly nigga gettin' away with bein' pretty boy

(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Now this is how the sporty bounce
We stay away from you broke-ass niggas
Always beggin' and ain't got a dime on the 40 ounce
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
'Cause ho you to' back, with that ol' long ass roll
And ya stockings smellin' like Avon, and that horse want his 'fro back
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
And nigga I can't stand ya
And I ain't got nothin' but some advice
A map, a bar of soap, some water and a towel to hand ya
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Now I'mma be real wit' it
All my fuckin' life I ain't never wanted fame
But since the shit done came I gotta deal wit it
(I don't wanna party wit you)
Ya know, but I'mma do it like my homie say
Check it, I don't give a fuck about fame (fa sho)
I'd rather deal with the money, y'all can have the name

Medley For a ‘V’ (The Pussy Medley),Rhythm-al-ism,1998.0,"Ayo, G-One, I've been listening to this nigga Quik album
And he ain't got no songs about the pussy
You know that nigga gotta have something about the pussy on
This shit, you feel me?
And I'm just that nigga to beat the pussy up
So, uh, if you feel me like I feel you, ya know what I'm sayin'
Let me get a little piece of this thang here like that there
Trip...

Let a nigga from the E.S. L.B. D.P
Beat that pussy 'til it's soft and mushy
I love that bushy, and most niggas still do
Unless that bitch shit smells like mildew
We'll do damn near anything to get it
And once I got it, I'm outtie, I stay 'bout it
I sip a little tea then light up my weed
I slip on my rubber out the cover then I proceed
To give your little thick ass what you need
Gangsta gangsta, I'll make ya cootie cat scream
Didn't I turn ya on like a phone?
You lovin' that Doggy Dogg meaty bone
When ya moan, ya whole voice tone
Make me wanna put my bizalls in ya jizaws, and y'all
Know what I'm gettin' at, I'm spittin' at
Nigga wanna fuck, trick; so what's up, bitch? (biotch)
See as long as my muthafuckin' dick get hard
And I got a million dollars banked out on my credit card
No disrespect or no disregard
But I'm hoppin' for that pussy like they used to hop for cars
My nigga DJ Q told me come on through
'Cause he got a gang of bitches that was down to do
Keep it poppin' since I'm from the big LBC
That's right down the street from Compton
I pop in the liquor store to grab some hay
A bag of ice, some blue dice, and some Cognac
Yeah, the pussy's good
Especially when it's from a whole 'nother neighborhood
How good do it get when you on that G shit?
I'm strokin' that pussy 'til that bitch seasick
We dick bitches down and that's Rule #3 in the Dogg Pound
Bitch, drawers down!

We won't get no radio play
But we probably get some pussy for this (What you say?)
I said we won't get no radio play
But we probably get some pussy for this

You can't be, can't be, you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be, let you be my playmate

Uhh, baby, let's sip wine while we 6-9
I'll slide on this rubber and we'll be just fine
Now if my condom broke and my ass got smoked
I'ma still get to Heaven on a little rubber boat, uhh
Snoop hit it then I hit it too
Aww yeah, little bitch, I'm talkin' 'bout you
Now all you ever do is sit around and boo-hoo
Talkin' 'bout, ""Hi-C, I loved-ed-ed you!""

She said, ""Where ya been?""; I said, ""In ya mouth""
If you're lookin' for love then take me down south
And I'll tell you all the things to make ya laugh and giggle
While I insert my eight inch shaft up in your tender vittles
A hot pocket, Snoop Dogg told me to stop it
He heard me in the other room bangin' her womb
And baby better do me like I'm one in a million
Check yo' feelings, and point that ass to the ceiling
'Cause I'm the ""dick 'em down king""; call me on the celly, let it ring
And prepare your lips for the ding-ding
And if you got some friends, let 'em bend on over
While I ride 'em like a '98 Rover
You can wish and you want, but this dick you're gonna meet
Hit your elbows and knees and spread your booty cheeks
And call me Daddi with a ""I""
Girl, you're doin' everything by the book
Nate Dogg, tell 'em how she looked

Girl, you're lookin' fine, so fine
I wonder if you'd like to take the time to grind
If so, why don't you leave with me today, let's play
This game I call it touch a secret place, let's play
See, first I just grab ya from behind ya mine
And then I just push until I find that line
By now, I know you've came a couple of times, that's fine
As long as you know I have to leave in time
You can't be...You can't be, can't be, you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be, let you be my playmate
You can't be, can't be, you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be, let you be my playmate

Now ain't nothin' like tight pussy on my dick
It's the Gangsta D, baby, never saved a trick
Got a harem full of hoes, mashin' to the studio
For all my niggas, you will get busy, ho
Now the first bitch she want dick to the tonsils
My second and third wanna fuck on the console
My fourth start to leak like the dookie chute shot
While my money-maker walking the stroll for my knot
Got that bitch mouth smellin' like fresh cock

Young twat—if I can smell it, I'mma tell ya to get going
With a douche pack, you're makin' my nose react
Reekin' but that ain't tweed or no yak
More like 25 pounds of get back
And I can tell by ya walk, it's talk back
But if that ain't yo' case, let me take a ride
On your love rollercoaster, pull them panties aside
KK

I'mma lean it to the left and to the right
And I'mma make ya scream and holla for more
And I bet you when I'm in it, you can't help but to admit it
You ain't never came this good before
Chevis-Regal got my dick so hard
I ain't gon' make it to the house because that's too far
Mr. Quik give me the keys to the Benzo
So I can hit it right here on the E-Lo Haaaaa Baaaaby
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light

Ha ha
Now I be still be knocking bitches like it ain't shit
Almost 10 years later but I still slang dick
And my penis, is like Venus, it's far away
And it's not butter, baby, more like Parkay
As we bounce to the city that you, used to know
The CPT with AMG, and all the bitches roll
We gon' be fly all the way G-ride
As we dip-dip-di, I shoot it in your eye
'Cause pussy ain't a thang to me
And my nuts when, they hang, they be okay to me
'Cause I'm a fly type of nigga; yeah, it's bigger
If you seen it on the muthafuckin microscope, it's bigger
Ha-ah-ah-ahahahah, in reverse like a muthafucka
Watching muthafuckas crash on that ass
Police videos, fuckin' all these hoes
I don't sunset with the hoes and shit
The pimps, girls, and the prostitutes
The prostitutes running from the police
It ain't nothing but a three P on me
Mr. Dante, baby, don't you see
Can we flip, flip the shit back over let me hear it

"Down, Down, Down",Rhythm-al-ism,1998.0,"My name is Quik & I be moving fast like a race car
But I'm top seed #1 like the pace car
Whether you up on me or you chillin' way far
You can tell almost immediately that I'm aced off
So listen muthafucka why you comin' off hard
My objective is to catch you off guard
Get covert & infiltrate yo' clique
Crack yo' shit & mack yo' bitch
Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver
Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather
And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her
Cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno-
Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl
Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas
Baby do you really wanna play the flute on me?
I'll give you a sack & take it back & you'll die to get it
Little punk cause I'm fly with it

When we come up we gettin' down down down
Step in the club they give us pound pound pound
Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown & round
DJ Quik & AMG with a brand new sound
(repeat)

I told her don't chase it but you can place it
In between your jaws to taste it
Or leave it in the basement
I be the riddler that's too familiar get in the middle of ya
And then I diddle ya, dick ya down 'til it tickles
Smack the booty with no pimples
Caress ya back then rub ya nipples
Baby I'm a crack fiend get the KY & if I'm at a jiggalo
Baby say hi fly like a eagle in a Range Rover or a Regal
Lookin' for the party people & when I catch ya baby girl
You should feel lucky we can make love
But don't forget to fuck me
Cause you got more bounce than Roger Troutman
I don't know when it's in or out and
Soak me baby give me that good thang
Ain't nothin' wrong with a coochie bang
Cause Suga Free, Mausberg, Quik & the AM
Definitely knows how to play 'em
Cause we went from demos to limos to luxuriousies
To models from Milan on they knees

When we come up we gettin' down down down
Step in the club they give us pound pound pound
Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown & round
AMG & Mausberg with a brand new sound
(repeat)

Oh you didn't know that I'm the bomb baby
Well take a toke of this D-I- & you gon' be feelin' flizie
Cause I be's Mausberg the superior
Steppin' through the club pound pound so ya fearin' us
But don't trip we keep the vibe right
Baby buy me some Remy & if
Yo' baby daddy trippin' tell him beep me
Cause I be's Black & Tone & swift up on my toes
G'd up in alligate's and black steel toes
Can I get a pound pound? (pound pound)
If Free the flyest who am I? (You the realest)
Look into my eyes & tell me what do you see
Oh you jockin' my entourage DJ Quik & AMG
Well get yo' groove on cause I ain't hatin' on the homies
When that 9-5th drop you & yo' sister gon' be on me
All I wanna do is slide up in & slide back out
Slap you in yo' face & stick it dead in yo' mouth
You think I'm bullshittin' well meet me after my show
Bring yo' lips to that all white stretch limo
So we can ride, slide, dip & glide Booyah!
And do our thang cause my whole clique fly

It feel good don't it?
It ain't no good if it ain't good enough
To put the proper hood on it
Peep how I struck up bitch jump in the air
Stay there until I tell you come down
& when you do you shut the fuck up
She'll sell a nice dream but bitch you'll
Have better luck tryin' to find 2 Pac than
Me buying you somethin' off the ice cream truck
Oxygen you leave 'lone leave me 'lone
Before I lock you in that little bitty box again
Don't let up y'all just keep her soakin' wet up
Playa playa & tell her when she need to shut up
Don't lighten up naw nigga you better you better tighten up
Throw ya head back back back back
Lean it to the side hey playas (Yeah!)
Tell 'em that we fly (We fly!) Ooooh catastrophe!
Bitch rather slide down a slide of razor blades
Into a pool of pimp piss but this ho had the audacity
To ask me for a dollar even though that's all I had left
These greedy lying ass hoes'll fifty cents yo' ass to death!

When we come up we gettin' down down down

Get Down,Trauma,2005.0,"(Shoot back)
I'm hard and I'm flossy and I'm all that
You talk a lot of shit, where yo' bodyguard at?
I got a pocket full of money, where the mall at?
Where the quads at, where the drinks, where the broads at?
(Shoot back)
Niggas fightin' over bitches need to squash that
You shouldn't be disgruntled cause you didn't learn to posh that
It's black pussy and I'm still tryin' to wash that
Rinse it up, lip to butt, right between the center gut
(Shoot back)
Sit in my lap, and look at my snaps
Drop a twenty and watch these troublemakers fightin' for scraps
My drawers so clean, my nuts are so powdered
Don't stress me out, just eat your clam chowder
Tryin' to stick my honeybee into yo' flower
If you like this record then make the shit louder
(Shoot back)
It's so terrific out on the Pacific
Green plants and dancin' make you feel lifted
I'm DJ Quik and I'm so fuckin' gifted
That you didn't even feel when the momentum shifted
(Shoot back)
I turned the pocket around
And slowed it all the way down, I'm a musical cop now

Get down on the ground, spread your legs, put your hands behind your back
Get up and walk backwards towards me
You under arrest for them big-ass breasts
And that ass made me think you had a strap, pick your ass up
Get down on your face, spread 'em wide, where your ID?
Why you tryin to lie to me?  you've got the right to remain
Either you can ride the big-ass bus
Go to jail or go home with us, I need backup

Excuse me miss, I'm pullin' you over
Cause your ass is extremely too fat
You need backup Quik?  I'm the right nigga to get
My picks are thick stallion, I'm slangin' the dick
Still bangin' the bricks, with the 'caine and the six
Remain in the mix, because I'm famous and shit
(Shoot back)
Let the guest in, doors open, my entourage walked in
Let's get some whore scopin' I'm open for more pokin'
On my wrist is fifty tokens, buy that chump
Sold a show out for a mill', try that chump
I'm on the boat still listenin' to, ""Way 2 Fonky""
Park that ass right hurr chick and make that monkey
Talk for me, when ya walk I see
A clear speech come and get it I got some for each
Now I'm bumpin' on the radio and put it on repeat
Play it loud in the streets, go out and get yourself a freak
The moral of the story is we ho-hoppin police
Know your rights, put these cuffs on, you locked in these sheets

Get down on the ground, spread your legs, put your hands behind your back
Get up and walk backwards towards me
You under arrest for them big-ass breasts
And that ass made me think you had a strap, pick your ass up
Get down on your face, spread 'em wide, where your ID?
Why you tryin to lie to me?  you've got the right to remain
Either you can ride the big-ass bus
Go to jail or go home with us, I need backup

Excess cologne, women be attracted
Got the best sex c'mon, it's somethin' 'bout the action
When they flex wet and bone, a model or a actress
I attach this note, before the script get wrote
(Shoot back)
She see the list, text you're gone
I tap it make it happen stress there's eggs at home
A captain be reactin' to the sweat as you moan
Hold up give me a second
I think Quik got somethin' else to say before we end this record

This beat is for your uncle and aunt
It's old enough to be dope, but young enough to be hot
Dedicated to everybody been beat by the cops
Just tryin' to get to the party and pop tequila in shots
The legendary incendiary resentment for authority figures
From the most vocal of the local niggas
California to death, bringin' Compton to life
Makin' beats that'll snap yo' neck and have you writin' a check
You need to

Get down on the ground, spread your legs, put your hands behind your back
Get up and walk backwards towards me
You under arrest for them big-ass breasts
And that ass made me think you had a strap, pick your ass up
Get down on your face, spread 'em wide, where your ID?

Ha ha yeah check it out money & pussy make the world go 'round
(That's right) That's how it's been since the beginning of time
Now who says we can't be fly?
Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla
At the same time get some thigh
Well uh that's the subject of my conversation
Cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar & some penetration
Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days
But uh some of you playas still be going out sideways
So umm just take this game with a tic tac
Cause if you was on Skid Row you can get
Pussy faster than a Big Mac
I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy
Cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy
Because uhh ""Sometimes they feel like a nut""
But they rather have it more often than they don't
So I won't go flippin' & makin' it topsy turvy
Now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp & that ass curvy
Cause ain't nuthin' on my mind but to be fly through time
Havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine
Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub
Eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' & getting a back scrub
Because 
first you get the power then you get the money
Then you get the pussy

So we all can hit the spot (now you gotta shake the spot)
Got game by the tons lookin' for some 2nd II None
Kinda fun but these hookers on the run for cover
They lookin' for lovers ain't no trickin' young D
Cause I'm unlike the others not a buster
I'm on the mission for figures time up for you diggers
(Now who got the Henn'?) Pass the liquor
Hoes hear the name it get's 'em hotter
Spin a scraggler on a wheel now they call me D the Potter
Lotta hatin' going on but I ain't with it
I'mma mash on that drama everytime that I feel it
Cause I'd rather have a major end than have sex
And when I have a million to splurge you know what's next
But first you get the power then you get the money
Then you get the pussy fool don't be no dummy

Now baby break yourself get broke you can choke
Off this young black better than Mary Jane
In ya brain I'm guaranteed to have ya thinkin' & feelin' thangs
Like yourself now uhh watch ya health if ya feel like plottin'
Ya body turns rotten from the inside out that pussy's turned out
Getting hit by a sucker a 2 minute brother
Who's first 10 seconds is thinkin' he came up
That next full minute suckin ya drama up
50 seconds to go see half of that is the show
Now where the other half you can't laugh
Cause you know it's straight simpin' & whinin'

That's where me and the PPC were just clownin'
Doin' what we had to do to get by
No money in my pocket but I was still fly
Curl to my neck but I got respect
And now I stack fat sacks and ride around in a Lex
And oh my, bitch, how you've changed
I see you rubbin' all on my dick and it's feelin' kinda strange
'Cause then you wouldn't even walk me around the block
But now your tryin' to throw me that tore up cock
I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole
I gots to keep the P in it, baby, muthafuck you hoes
But open up wide if you givin' up head
Because, close mouths don't get fed
I'm talking to you punk ass, trick ass, nuttin' ass bitches
What's the name of your perfume ""Vicious""?
Hoes ain't shit, ain't gon' be, ain't never will be
And I'ma make you feel bad that you fucked me
So fast-forward, tricks, this is strictly for my dogs
Ballin' like a muthafucka, ragtop hogs
And El Co's keep rollin' to this gangsta shit
And when I feel like being bothered with you bitches
I'm givin' ya..

Bookie Loc mobbin' through with D and a couple of half G's
So is you down for the skeeze?
I'm on my way
Now the bitches at Gina's, they all wanna see me
Put my telephone down for the LAPD
They passed me, I pass them, and they didn't even trip
Now I'm doin 55 over the Arlington Dip
And my Lexo's rollin', got me feelin' superior
With the funky white pearl and black leather interior
My niggas in my truck, we ain't givin a fuck
We caravanin' fast pace to 42nd place
Scooped up Bleu and headed back to the strip
In the left hand turnin' lane, niggas stare but don’t trip
Bust a right on Normandie, the bitches blow for me
But I don't pay 'em no mind 'cause they come second to my homies
Hit the spot and bell' but I don't step in the mud
Walk up in the living room and it's smellin' like bud
In the kitchen where it ain't no drinks but a gang a food
Ahh, let me pop the trunk 'cause I brought a little...

Somethin' 4 tha mood (yeah)
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood (ya know)
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap (mmm...)

Now I dips to the studio to listen to the hits
2nd II None workin' on some brand new shit
And it's tighter that a muthafucka, got that swang
While Big Jake tryna take a nigga straight to Beijing
But I pass on the bud, I mash on the brew
Genuine Draft for my muthafuckin' crew
Tajai's chillin', China just trippin'
Chris engineering and Bacon and George sippin'
So listenin' to this track makes you understand
Why niggas still can't fuck with the one-man band
Got my dark locs clean with the P on my crown
And my black leather trench to the muthafuckin' ground
And I'm faded, knowin' I don't wanna drive drunk
In case I get jacked, got my shit in the trunk
Now I might have been swerving but I made it to the tip
Just another day in the life of Quik
I'm givin' ya...

Somethin' 4 tha mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Something for the mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(And you know I got...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood (you know, baby)
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap (and we up out)",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-somethin-4-tha-mood-lyrics
Fandango,Trauma,2005.0,"You might find me in the Century Club
Fresh kicks, fresh cut, pocket full of dubs
Box of Altoids for my paranoid niggas actin foul
Stop smokin if you can't be proud
Adult star night, not another bar fight
Inglewood players actin right in the spotlight
Me I'm righter than invisible set
I'm visibly wet, slurrin and I'm lookin for my pet
I pass to the massa with her whip on her, ask her
If she sippin wit'cha bird, if she not we move past her
And I ain't hatin I'm just diggin ya ass girl
Is that the collagen shot, is that what'cha momma got?
I'm so rugged, bullet wound in back
Of the axe handle blunt force trauma kinda tuggin
And I ain't never been what the cat drug on
B-Real Quik's to keep ya mean muggin
California clownin, bounce to sundown
In the moonlight groovin, trippin off the saloon fight
We Fandango, the next day hangover
Got me feelin like I hit a train with my Range Rover

Feel free to lose your mind, let'cha brain go
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha dame go
Spin around 'til you get a hangover
Take your doo rag off, let your brain grow
Fuck the tango do the Fandango
Triple step, right left, then you let'cha man go
Spin around 'til you get a hangover

Watch me climb out the whip with the bird on my hip
She wanna set it off in the club, don't trip
We crack a bottle and all my fam take a sip
Any haters wanna pop at the lip, we come equipped
We get the paper and the savor the flavor
But never forget about the haters who constantly imitate us
Homey we creators and players and rhyme sayers
For layers of words, let me say it in terms that you can understand
So clearly, you feelin me fam?
She's on the floor cause of my homey Quik man
And she hits the mall but you don't really understand
Yeah I seen it before but now it's gettin out of hand
Mami's diggin for more, and she's posin for the cam
Little beef got the dancefloor slammed
No tango, straight Fandango
Birds flock to us like heads to Kangols, c'mon


I'm a master in disguise, movin swiftly to the thighs
Move faster than me, then I recognize
That I ain't really got nuttin to hide
But the bratwurst skinny girl second, fat girls first
And Compton is still on my mind
I remember when we used to get scared when they got behind us
One-time sayin they been tryin to find us
But they got the wrong niggas, never mind us
My tongue tumbles like I'm bumblebee stung
Rip out the stinger, you keep talkin shit I whip out the ringer
How many times does it have to end
Right before 12:00 A.M., why you packin a Slim Jim?
I gets down on the mic like I rode down on a bike
Road rash, skin peelin tonight
The club ain't never crackin 'til the haters be gone
We need to build the eliminator hater light, and put it on 'em",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-fandango-lyrics
Trouble,Under Tha Influence,2002.0,"I'm not ya one hit wonder
And when you see me on the streets in a black jeep
Know I got the heat up under
Not up under the seat, up under my cheek
Like so close to me that when I move it squeaks
I ain't no big buff dude I'm a rap singer
I exercise one muscle that's my strap finger
And I can't call it how I see it no more
Cause these niggas'll take ya words back and twist em' like a pretzel
And these bitches be the same too
Comin' with that sob story crocodile tears trying to game you
And that's exactly what the game do
And if you ever get caught dirty with a nigga she gon' blame you
So what in the hell you want to floss her for?
It's supposed to be bout' what a baller nigga cost that ho (yeah)
You givin' a game of black eye in ya S-5
While you niggas kick back poppin' X you let that cuz' dry
And that bitch supposed to carry her own car note (c'mon, yep)
And don't be going for that shit ""I got a sore throat"" (yeah)
Give that bitch a couple of Sucrets (mmm hmm)
Or give that that ho that application down on Vernon to that duplex (see ya)

A 5-double-0 and a Rover truck
I bend 'em all over 'til I know they stuck
Want to tell your friends that you fucked with A
But how many dicks did ya suck today?
Do we play ball? Do we move that weight?
All I got for a motherfuckin' ho is hate
Bitch want to get drunk and high
Point that booty on to the sky
Square ass bitch go bake a pie
Get a tattoo of a dick in ya eye
Want to be flied call Continental (bitch)

Etched in stone, makin' yo bitch fetch the bone

Nightstick up yo ass 'til we all see blood
Fuck ya, I'm a cop too (what?)
I'm a cop me a kilo of yay
And try to get it crackin' like it's '82 (ahh yeah)
With Monte Carlos and European firms cop them El Co's on that gold lace
Dippin' round the whole place (whole place)
Fuck a 6-pack nigga cop the whole case (whole case)
And when them marks come nigga crack they whole face

So Many Wayz,Rhythm-al-ism,1998.0,"Yo, this is DJ Quik
And quite frankly
I think we gotta be some of the baddest motherfuckers
That ever fucked with rap music
Cause this album right here is on some old cool shit
If you don't believe me
Just give me three and a half seconds and I'll show you
You ready?
One, one and a half
Two, two and a half
Three, three and a half, uh
Yeah
Got my niggas 2nd II None up in this bitch
My nigga Peter Gunz, that's right
AMG, El Debarge, Playa Hamm, Hi-C, Suga Free
Check this shit out

I'm like fries in a skillet—much too hot to hold
I'm strong and I'm handsome and black, plus I'm bold
A mental case, sometimes stressin' but then I flip
Because you got to go crazy on Hollywood for your grip
And you know ain't no room in my mirror for your face
And if I got y'all confused like Rubik then state yo case
Yet creepshow suckas keep tryin to submerge mine
But I can hold my breath for a long time
I emerge with treasures and coins, a thick sack
And your life ain't mine to take, now kick back
'Cause if it don't make dollas—sucka, you know the poem
Cause either you pimping this game or you just hoing
Now get up outta mine, nigga I'm the bomb
Droppin heat on your homeboys and spreadin like napalm
Cause I got more styles than your car's got miles
And I, got more styles than a hotel's got towels
Cause I kicks it in...

So many ways (Uh huh and we can flip it in)
So many ways (Cause we can rock a party)
So many ways (Got bomb for everybody)
So many ways (Now baby can you feel it in)
So many ways (Cause you know we can deal it in)
So many ways (And I can make your body numb in)
So many ways (Cause you ain't never heard a nigga come)
So many ways (Ah hah, ah hah)
(Verse 2: Gangsta D of 2nd II None)
I'm chillin, mackin, stackin up these ends
I gots to check a knot, I gots no time for no friends
I bust a trick, make her bounce like a low-low
While I'm twisted off that bud, countin money at the mo-mo
No flow so, ain't no need to tell the po-po
Believe me bra', all the snitches get the fo-fo
Now here we come again with a brand new twist
On God, I rock the party like this
With so many ways to get paid, I hustle for days
The tenth of the month I get my government aid
And the used-to-be-crooks, I'm puttin money on they books
Cause satan got busy and many souls got took
We shook up the world I did it with my partner
For his sons and my daughter, you don't have to be no baller
To kick it with me, see, I stay real G
D forever feedin all you punk hoes misery

So many ways (I can get busy)
So many ways (I gots to get the scrilly)
So many ways (We can have a mardi-gras)
So many ways (Cause I can rock the party y'all)
So many ways (Tell me can ya feel it in)
So many ways (I gots to make the dividends)
So many ways (You know I keep it real in)
So many ways
(Verse 3: KK of 2nd II None)
I was known for triple M shots and straight plottin
But hittin them hoes had me wastin up a knot
And all these figaros scrubs waitin to get hot
Now it's cool, you got your spot without that funky cot
And that dramatic experience you and him went through
Ain't got nothin to do with the K, so keep cool
Little girl, this ain't no Hollywood play
Go somewhere else and play them sucka games you play
Catch the redline metro rail, blaze a trail
I can feel you ain't real and I can tell
From meetin different people, fingers to throats
Scandalous to the rich, goodhearted to the broke
And these young and old folk, they like to hear good music
If it's weak lose it, but if it's bumpin choose it
But don't abuse it and try to take it to the brain
If you do you'll be caught up in a strain
And be hangin on my thang in

So many ways (Now watch me put it down in)
So many ways (You know I like to get my clown in)
So many ways (We can flip the sound in)
So many ways (K and D got it humpin in)
So many ways (You know you wanna bump it in)
So many ways (We can have a mardi-gras)
So many ways (You know I rocks the party y'all)
So many ways

So many ways (x8)

I walk three thousand miles for a taste of that gangsta shit
Messin around with G-One and the DJ Quik
Stick and move from east-west in vest like stocks
I went from pushin Nikes to pushin drops
Fuck around and go platinum quick, messin with Quik
Nigga got hits like Switch so watch your trick
See me playin Avirex and the Pepe's
No shirt on, your girl sweat me and I'mma hit it if she let me
Backsides bangin, hangin, all amazed
She get this dick in (So many ways)
Blow her back out then I mack out, freak the keys to the Lex
Or find me havin sex in my NSX
I'm from the BX but we flex from East to West
So while you niggas coast-trippin we'll be cashin them checks
Peter Gunz, one of the most in-credible ones
G-One, Quik, we rolls thick and gets the job done in

So many ways (Cause I kick it in)
So many ways (You know that I can flip it in)
So many ways (And I can rock a party)
So many ways (I got bomb for everybody)
So many ways (Bring it from the Bronx in)
So many ways (From New York to Compton)
So many ways (We keep it pumpin)
So many ways (Uh)

Get At Me,Safe + Sound,1995.0,"(Now I got to cut ya...)
Yeah, ha ha, that's right
'Cause it's like this
Yeah, it's gotta be like this
Nigga

It used to be a CPT thang (what)
But now it's just an all me thang (yeah)
Because I'm tired of this gizame (right)
I'm through playin' for a crew that ain't got my back
When I'm the one who done created the sack
Mister You Know Who, remember me?
I met you when I was PPC
And you wasn't nothin' but a scrub
Wearin' plaid pants and bubble gums and beggin' for grub
But then when ya grip start growin'
You tripped and flipped and skipped out
Huh, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Not even thinkin' 'bout the time
When KK took yo' ass in 'cause you didn't have a dime
Nigga couldn't even say thanks for the trouble
I would've spanked yo' ass on the double
'Cause when ya didn't have a place to stay
You little round the way girl, my nigga took yo' weight
And that way all my homies had yo' back
Because together they knew we had a fat ass sack
But you couldn't stand the guns
Couldn't wait to take ya (Bitch betta have my) money and run
KK should've knew the motto of life (what's that?)
That ya can't turn a ho into a housewife (ha)
Because you left a lot of people unhappy
Nigga, you in debt ( And ya need to get at me)
Yeah

I know what you're sayin' (that's right)
I know what you're doin' (so ya need to get at me)
I know what you're sayin' (huh)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)

Now I can name a gang of niggas I done tripped with
Spent a grip with and they ain't spent shit
And they ain't never brought nothing to the table
But it ain't no puzzle, I'm able
But why you wanna take my kindness for weakness?
To get my money back, I gotta ride yo' ass like Preakness
It ain't that fly
And when ya see me in traffic, just ride by
You should've been a pigeon 'cause you duck so well
But next time I catch you I'ma pluck yo' tail
'Cause niggas like y'all show disrespect by flossin'
So you're in for a tossin'
You need to go brush your teeth
And change ya drawers and change ya sheets
And stop y'alls bitches
From steadily tryin' to ride on my meat
And start bathing more than once a week, nigga
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, bitches
So ya needs to come right with the quickness (come right)
And instead of tryin' to duck and dodge and be crafty
You need to get at me

I know what you're sayin' (hell yeah)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)
I know what you're sayin' (that's right)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)

So tell me how we gon' handle this
Either we gon' be men or we gon' be skanless
Either way is all right with me
'Cause I'ma show ya that I meant it
When I said that I'm a G, nigga
I don't take ganks too swell (naw)
That's why I went and bought a gang of shells
And if you approach me wrong, I'ma clown
First nigga run up  (""First down"")
Damn, I wish it didn't even have to come to this
'Cause now y'alls on my shit list
Right with the white boys in this game
Thinkin' they gone get the hits for some chump change
Please, huh, I didn't believe that you'll trip like that
That's how a gang of niggas flipped like that
So get back, fool, 'cause I'm going out
Comin' out of a straight jacket blastin' 
And they gon' have to get at me

I know what you're sayin' (hell yeah)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)
I know what you're sayin' (Compton style)
I know what you're doin' (you know what, y'all can never get at me)

Mo’ Pussy,Way 2 Fonky,1992.0,"""Give it to me!""

I wonder..
How would it feel, to sleep with a woman like you?
To fade that monkey til it's funky
Rollin' all over your bed, stickin to you like glue
You can call me a real funk junkie
Slangin this dick like dope
Strapped with a cap and I'm lookin' for the slope that leads
To the hairpie hoes, AMG knows
""Word to the motherfuckin' three-oh-fo's!""
Now pass that gin, and let's begin
And how you goin out?  That's how I'm goin in
Holdin' your titties, them big two knobs
Nuttin in your ass in big goo gobs
Sticky and it's tricky but I glide when I ride it
Tearin' down your walls cause I'm all up inside it
Cumin' to the fullest and you feel when I pull it
Yankin' that friction' is stankin'
But I don't go bareback, naked booty style
I'd rather live a long life, checkin' major pile
Cause H-I-V don't give a fuck about me
And so, I don't give a fuck about a ho
But what can I do?  I'm addicted to the coochie
No matter what I say, I'ma still need a hoochie
Tell me get a nut, each and every time I get a little pushy
""Say what?""  I gotta have mo' pussy
Chorus: {​sung}​
Just cause I didn't say, that I wanted to fuck (Well?)
Don't mean that I don't want to
Gimme some pussy!
I, need, a little mo' pussy
Just cause you didn't say, that you wanted to suck
Don't mean that you don't want to
Gimme that pussy!
I, need, a little mo' pussy

Now if you got friends, they can come to
But if they ain't playin safe ho you're through
Because my _Lifestyle_'s like a _Trojan_
I'm never DRY but I'm LUBRICATED, and the suckers hate it
Because they know, they don't stand a shot, at gettin that cot
They just don't know what makes you hot
See I learned way back, yo when I was young
You can get a girl sprung, if you lick the pearl tongue
And with that knowledge, I went to Bitch College
And got a P.H.D. for Pimpin' Hoes Daily
And when I fuck I cause much pain ho
Cause I bend this dick like a rainbow
Up and down, in and out
Flexin it, pokin it, strokin it, chokin
Cause you're feelin it, and I'm killin it
And like I said before I make you hit the ceiling bitch
Because hoes like you, you only come a dime a dozen
I fucked you and you told your cousin, now she wants some lovin
Oven hot pussy, yo she made me cum quick
Bouncin on my nuts like a pogo stick!
A tongue twista, she worked the shit like a lizard
I put her on her back, and I hit her in the liver
Stabbin' it, pokin that kidney see
I can make it deep - when I'm fadin that pussy
Chorus: {​sung}​
Just cause I didn't say, that I wanted to fuck (Well?)
Don't mean that I don't want to
Gimme some pussy!
I, need, a little mo' pussy
Just cause you didn't say, that you wanted to suck
Don't mean that you don't want to
You stupid ass bitch!
Go take a douche, you smell like shit!

One more time, for your mind and your behind
So take off your drawers, and prepare for the grind
I'm hornier than a motherfuckin horny-toad
So pull my dick, and put me in butt mode
Tonight I'm your robot, a supercharged ho-bot
Fill me up with Hennesey and I won't stop
I'll be your confidant baby you can trust in me
To fuck you swell enough to make your man envy
Cause I'm that nigga that'll fuck you til your hair fall out
And even if you wear a wig I'll still give
Service with a smile, you need a tune-up
Quik'll leave you leakin, and smellin like tuna
On second thought, I don't really like that smell
Cause yeast infections ruin my erections
I can take a hint ho, you ain't gotta push me
I'm outta here - outta what?  Out your pussy
Chorus: {​sung}​
Just cause I didn't say, that I wanted to fuck (Well?)
Don't mean that I don't want to
Gimme some pussy!
I, need, a little mo' pussy
Just cause you didn't say, that you wanted to suck
Don't mean that you don't want to
You stupid ass bitch!
Go take a douche, you smell like shit!
Just cause I didn't say, that I wanted to fuck (Well?)
Don't mean that I don't want to
Gimme that pussy!
I, need, a little mo' pussy
Just cause you didn't say, that you wanted to suck
Don't mean that you don't want to

Way back in 1991, I used to know her

Well 1991, I was rockin' my jheri curl, just a young gun
Lookin' for the bitches that have alot of fun
Just dropped a hit record now I'm under the sun
Winter time night fall cold as hell
Standin' outside of the Goldentail
Hella hoes mobbin' in pushin' gettin' through
Tiger striped cat suit looking at me too
I asked her ""what's your title"" and she said it was ""V""
Vanessa you impress a nigga, can't you see
What you doin' later can I kick it with you?
She said it all depends on what you wanna do
Took me to her buddy's house, walked in the room
Buzzin' off the kamikaze that I consumed
Talk, kiss, grind tyrin' to get get my balls off first
She said nigga can you take my draws off first
I was young I admit it
She told me I was horny and wild, but still let me hit it
Hot bare back until I felt that quake
She told me shoot that milk shake, shoot that milk shake
Goddamn I dont wanna get sprung
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy
Ran home to tell my nigga Top
About this cock that just wouldn't stop, yeah
I told him she was greeneyed light skinned and fly
He said he met a bitch like that last july
A car pulled up and it was her no doubt
I told him thats who I'm talkin' about
He said that's who I'm talkin' about damn
Hook

Now here's the plan
In the home of the one night stand
Rolled up in a stretch
Pussy to catch
Plus now I'm sittin' the V.I.P
And hoes wanna suck on the D.I.C, OK
So here's the play give me OJ and Tanqueray
Have you had you dick today
Is what im thinkin
But i've been drinkin
I see you peepin me out
And its freakin me out
Cause she fine than a motherfucker about 5'8
135 and I just can't wait (for what)
To hit the backside,and get the top love
Buck naked in the hot tub
Cause she knew who I was and what I am and what I is (who are you)
The flyest nigga in the rap biz
And they're playin' my song so a nigga gotta go and uh
Put a ho in the limo
She was askin' me question after question
Until she seen my life size erection
I bent her over prepared to do my duty
And seen my nigga Quik's name on her booty
Hook

Were running out of Beedies
Now who gon do the honors
I hit the liquor next to Benihana's
But on my way I met bitch as sqaure as a box
With a big ass booty and some goldie locks
And I ain't gotta do much talkin' she wet
Because she seen me movin' a '97 Corvette
The good thing is I never seen her around
So I took her to my spot to get down
Now AMG what you think about the bitch
She used to dance at the Jet Strip 
Shakin' the cock, 20 dollars a pop
A nick name babygirl, use to have a jheri curl
Now she got braids, ex-nigga paid
She use to roll a Lexo now she got a Pathfinder
Wear a rubber if ya get behind her
Cause my nigga told me she had the heebie geebies
Give her drank and dank she'll give a nigga freebies

We use to know her

And to you motherfuckers thinkin' you wanna fade me?

Fonky - yeah, fonky.. 
""you know I can't stop""
Fonky - yeah, fonky.. ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky - yeah, fonky.. ""you know I can't stop""
Fonky - yeah, fonky.. yeah

Now no sooner than I hit the fuckin' streets
People be approachin' me, all throughout the swap meets
Askin' me shit like, ""When your new album comin' out?""
""Is it different?"" ""Is it dope?"" ""Where yo' perm?""
What you talkin' bout?
I know you don't expect that a nigga gon' quit
Bein' nothin' less than funky and bangin' out the dope-ass hits
Cause DJ Quik is a name that I take much much pride in
No egoes to hide in and no limos to ride in
Maybe a Cutlass or two, but still the same ol' shit
And me unclever? No never, I'll have this talent forever
The producer get funky down to the last ounce
And I'm creative too - so I don't need ""Mo' Bounce""
But to you suckas in my city claimin' I got a ""Def Wish""
You should try again fool, you ain't hittin' near this
Them wack ass tracks, make you sound like a monkey
Just a shot in the dark, from a punk-ass mark who ain't Fonky


Now when you records ain't that funky then it's easy to disrespect this
Cause you know that when I hit I didn't miss
Just like that ""I'm Born and Raised,"" you wish you could fade
And when you picked up that album cover you knew I was paid, Tim
Cause we ain't goin' out and we ain't stuck in that old school shit
That boring flavour that just don't hit
Cause this is ninety-two, and yes yo' style is through
And if your record ain't sellin' well fool I thought you knew
That this is straight Bronx killa, straight Bronx murda
Yeah yo' city's a dump, and fool yo' shit don't bump
And 'member the 
""Jack the Rapper""?
 Yeah, your punk ass sat
That's when my homeboy D, was bout to flatten yo' cap
And you apologized to him, started kissin' his ass
Sayin' you only dissed Compton for the money, so he gave you a pass
But you ain't movin' shit on the streets
Get off the nuts of my city with them wack ass beats that ain't Fonky",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-way-2-fonky-lyrics
Fuck All Night,The Midnight Life,2014.0,"Sometimes I'm insatiable
Sometimes I love fellatio
With such a high sex ratio
She smirks when she swallows but she says it's tasty though
Call Lisa with her big 'ole ass
Her weave is cool but her mama is cash
And she would be just fine, it's not time to smash
Get some ointment, go and fix that rash
I got a fine groupie girl, eyes like a raccoon
Pussy so good, she deserves some damn balloons
When she wants to hit it, I go get it
She had a hot past, how could they forget it?
Now we don't even got Soul Train
Ain't got no room to grow, just like a swole brain
I'm like a doctor, keepin' you in remission
I don't write songs for bitches, I write prescriptions
Now get the head right, get the sheet thread count high
Cook some beans and rice, get the bath temperature nice
Then get it set up to get set off
Like Foxy, you'll get off when you let off and you let me toss
You da boss, bitch, I just wanna...

Fuck all night, fuck all night

I just wanna fuck all night, fuck all night
Fuck until what's wrong is right
Hey! I just wanna fuck all night, fuck all night

I just wanna fuck all night, fuck all night
Eat 'til her drawls is white

Don't FACETIME at night, that's Blair Witch
With her once-a-month bleedin' fonky cock
She got to check it every traffic stop
She fuckin' wit' you when you wanna talk
But lose a couple spots, and watch communication drops
No sympathy votes, 'cause I don't love no hoes
Empty pockets on the corner, keep 'em all broke
She been a ho now since 2003
And now she wants to get her life right with me?
Ambitious bitches, a little too enthralled with the riches
Don't want the one night boy, she want the pension
And that is not your spot, this is not your place
You need to fill your crotch up with your face
And quit tryin' to be a side piece, bitch!
With a pussy that big, you missed the chance to...

Fuck all night, fuck all night

You missed the chance to fuck all night, fuck all night

A ha ha 
you don't understand me goddammit
 
(I don't wanna eat it)
A ha ha ha nah baby I ain't wit' it (don't wanna eat it)
I can't do nothing for you on that tip girl (I don't wanna eat it)
So you can keep that salmon sandwhich to yo' self (don't wanna eat it)
Well I kick it for my niggas...
Peep

Getting right back back to the nigga named Q
Telling my homies be careful o' the things that you do
Cuz I went out, assed out
I shoulda never tripped and put my lips in between hips
But I used to eat that thang that didn't sit on a plate
Didn't taste like steak, got up and left about 8
But I had to build her make for the fact that I was young
I was showing to prove the hoochies I could work they pearl tongue
But then game got killed
Cuz the girl kept pushin' my head all up under the quilt
And I was like damn, you must be sick
You mean you'd rather have a tongue
Instead of a pair o' nuts and a stick (You goddamn right)
And every single night, I lick it till my tongue turn white
I thought I was a freak till I heard my homies brag
(Eating that coochie make you grow a mustache)Ya!
So I took that advice and right before I hit it
I took baby monkey lift it up and I bit it
Yeah homeboy I had the coochie in check
But then I got this real bad cramp in my neck
Now my back got so'
But this little ho kept a humping in my face like we was on the dance flo'
But thats what I get for having Suzy Q for dinner
Got stuck in her creamy pink center
Help me
Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't eat the coochie) You gotta hear me tho'
(don't....eat the coochie)
(don't....eat the coochie) A he he you think its a joke huh girl?
(don't....eat the coochie)

Well my nigga, you ought to save yo' self some grief
If it ain't worth havin' a little hair in ya' teeth (don't fuck with it!)
Ya cuz you'll come up sho't
With a full pair of nuts and a lump in ya throat
Cuz even though shes finnin'
She don't want ya semen
She just want a tounge to keep her ass creamin'
But Im'a let her know baby doll I can't do it
Not in here and fuck cuz all coochie got a catch to it
See I don't know who been digging you out
And dicking ya down
I ain't the first, girl, so I can't clown
But instead, Im'a tell you how its done
You gotta tell a ho 68 and I owe you 1
Cuz if you don't then she'll play you like a sucka
Have you lickin on a lollipop... {dumb motherf...}
Yeah! But it ain't no trippin on mine {Why is that?}
Cuz tounge condoms are hard to find {Yeeeah}
And even if ya dicks protected
You can still catch the HIVe by doing a nose dive
So be cautious and don't be anxious
Even though you never could
Now you really can't trust these Statures
(Now you wanna trust these Statures)
But niggas still put they nuts in a frier
Then they get burnt and they wanna fight fire with fire
And then burn a bitch back
But to solve that, don't bare back
And please don't eat the coochie
Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Yeah
(don't....eat the coochie) You better hear me baby
(don't....eat the coochie) I can't do it girl
(don't....eat the coochie)

Peep...
So now ya know
Ain't nothin' fly bout' the pearl tounge lickin'
And be real safe with the girls your stickin'
Cuz if ya' bare back way back in the day
Then you could be on your wayyyy out! (On your wayyy out!)
And it don't get no brighter
When youre walking round with a tongue like a lighter
Bic (Bic) flick sparkin' often
Sittin in the middle o' the clinic, coughin'
And for the die hard bare back feelin'
They got shook like kids from a sinnin'
Dwellin' all in your system
Killin' ya slooow
A real jacked up way to go
So next time you get a fi-fi in ya bed
Make sure you gots you a helmet for the head
Have her wash up if the ho is a hoochie
And keep your mouth away from that coochie
Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Repeat 7X
You gotta hear me baby
I'm tellin' you
Do you feel me?
You gotta hear me girl
Nah I can't do it
I can come close though
I might lick ya bellybutton and shit

U Ain’t Fresh,Balance & Options,2000.0,"(Verse 1 - DJ Quik)
I know you like to do ecstacy, and then forget where you are
Be up in a room with a stripper, and your homie Lamar
Now that's a nasty threesome, a straight mis-match
Instead of bangin' on the broad, you'd rather open his hatch
And start packin'... and get some dookie on your tip
Don't look now, you got a loogie on your lip
Next time video tape it, let us all see it
This is Sir Herb, I'll put you on the web - you pervert
The number 23 on the beats,
 'bout to do ya
Mister Blake A.K.A. DJ Quik talkin' to ya
And I'll prove I'm proper and yo game is whack with 1 line
I'll never put my name on a track that wasn't mine
This hip-hip shit, is getting stupid again
These niggas gun-tottin', fightin', gettin' rutless again
There's a message in the Big Book, didn't you read it?
It say if niggas don't remember the past, they gonn' repeat it
So I'm into ???ated
That ground heart-stated
And we all made it
If you want a hit, nigga, call David
The first name basis, depends on how the pay is
50 under the table do it enough, don't need a label
Cause I rob from the rich and I... gives to the flo
So let's stay focused cause the chip is the prize
Now put your shit in first, nigga, and shift it to rise
And like Frank Nitti, ?We 2-degree?
And you haters trippin' cause I got the key to the city
Not a sissy but the hoes keep callin' us pretty
And you mad cause the bitch got me on her titty
Mr. Troutman talk me talkbox, Doo Wa Ditty!
And I'll tell you to your ear, nigga, you sound shitty
I'll take your ho up to the room and show her no pity
So call me DJ Meow Mix cause we gets kitty (meow)
Scratchin' all the fleas off of these
Stayin' high off of trees
Top villian, and enjoyin' the breeze
And the time I'm spendin' in yo bitch, a supreme blast
In the back of my S-500
 playin' Dreamcast
(Chorus)
You Ain't Fresh (7x)
You a busta, nigga!
You Ain't Fresh (7x)
You a busta, nigga!
(Verse 2 - Erick Sermon)
Yo, yo, I'm into somethin' new, hoppin' through
Quicker than the Compton Crew, and Y too
Yo, what you wanna do? You ain't fresh!
No contest - we cook like Raekwon the Chef
And write for the skills, get set for the kill
And prep for the meals, after that we chill
The E-R-I-C-K is my name, I spell
Bring it back like '92, with clientele
And keep shit right, and make sure the sound excite
Nigga in affect, like flashlight
Quik and I do it 'til death
In the house 'yall, blackin' out like Red & Meth
Thick-boned women, in jeans and linen
Yeah (whew!), make a nigga wanna go fishin'
And when I walk by, girls singin' a song
Like E... is like a phemomenon
Ugh, al around the world they be bumpin' to E
Shuttin' it down, right in your company
I blow through like a gust of wind, through doors
Tearin' down the roof, rippin' the floors
Cause rap's no game, I pack heat, ain't afraid to pull it
For what packs, I packs full of bullets
Stop when I come through
Big, Black, motherfucker fresh for '99
You suckas!
(Chorus)
You Ain't Fresh (7x)
You a busta, nigga
You Ain't Fresh (7x)
You a busta, nigga
(Verse 3 - Kam)
Kam got get-back
So get up off my dick, rat
Nigga, that shit whack
You want a hit track?
Where Quik at?
Knick, knack, patty whack
I only bone dimes
How you tight? You don't even write your own rhymes
It's been a long time
Since you last heard from me
Like Bill ass Hillary, ""what's up?""
Still love me, pretty young thang?
City I'm from bang
What's up, nigga?
Real G's don't wear titty and tongue rings
You's a fruity-o, you make the most excuses
And keep a studio full of ghost producers
Young boss heard
You was tryin' to floss, nerd
Hollerin' ""which side is the realest?""
Who you steal that from? (Mausberg)
The street slang thief is your chief employment
You live a life full of grief after brief enjoyment
Fake gang bangers, when you see us, tuck all rags
Adios, buenos dias, fuck y'all fags!

Loked Out Hood,Quik is the Name,1991.0,"HA HA HA HAA!
One day I was chillin on Aranbe and Spruce
40 in my hand and it's time to get loose
Got my Nikes on my feet, my T-shirt, and black khakis
I heard a horn blowin', looked up, it was Jackie
Shawn was chillin' in the passenger seat
Stripped up out the bra and started dancing in the street
Now Shawn lookin' fresh and it wasn't no joke
She had on the fresh khakis and was sportin' the locs
And Thad was poppin' wheelies, came up from behind
He got off throwin' up his favorite gang sign
Here come Little Slug from the Maple block
Groovin' on the handlebars, ready to rock
And now my posse's gettin' bigger because of all these niggas
I got the .38 and I'm about to pull the trigger
Looked up at the corner and who did I see?
Wayne, Inch, Little Man, Pot and Nookie
Now Shot came rollin' up on a little scooter
Lookin' for a match so he could light the Thai huddha
I told him I didn't have it, but yet I went to grab it
I lit it up, I hit it up, and now I'm draggin' it
Wayne took a hit, Pot took a puff
Nookie started chokin' and now he's fucked up
The 40-ounce is empty, so I busted into school
I'm never gettin' sweated 'cause I'm just too cool, fool
Sun's goin' down and now it's night
My posse's cold chillin' and we're feelin' alright
We heard a lot of noise and it sounded like a rally
Boomin' ass sounds comin' out of Sherm Alley
We all jumped up and we started to stroll
A young nigga like the Quik was takin' control
The D.E.A. Posse, so deep we walk in twos
And if you wanna join, well, you gotta pay your dues
We got up to the alley and everything was chill
They was just makin' that dollar dollar bill
Reesy came down and she sat on the stairs
I stood up 'cause I didn't have a chair
Now Pot said, ""Slug, go get some cups
And get the Olde 8 so we can get fucked up.""
Now I'll put in twenty, Inch put in ten
And said, ""Fuck it--Super Socco and gin!""
Now everybody's gettin' in the twilight zone
Head up stairs straight getting' his bed on
Gangsta on the steps and he's tryin' to bang
No belt in his khakis so to his knees they sag
Now here comes Slick with a 20 dollar bag
But he can't roll a joint 'cause he ain't got the zigzags
I looked up at my watch, it said 10:28
""You better rush the liquor store before it's too late.""
So he went up to the store and he got the zags
Came back walkin' with my homeboy Cash
This nigga came over, he was lookin' for a ride
Runnin' from the police, he didn't have no place to hide
A smile up on my face when I gave him a beer
I'm chillin' like a villain and I got no fear
Now Tony Lane came and he said he was bored
Eatin' on some chips that he got from the store
I said I'm bored too, so what's up with that?
Wayne said, ""Is anybody down to jack?
Now I can get the AK and you can get the pump
But I don't want a deuce-deuce, 'cause I ain't a chump""
Now Mike said, ""Dave, which one do you choose?""
I told him, ""I could take the .38 and you can have the Uz'.""
But before we can jet and be on our way
Some niggas rolled up and they was ready to spray
Rollin' real slow, they turned off the lights
Waitin'...until the time was right
A fool jumped out all dressed in Guess
(What's up *gunshot* muthafucka) (Yeah)
Got him in the chest
The niggas tried to jet, but they couldn't get far
'Cause Mike had the Uzi and he aimed it for the car
*gunshots*
Ha Ha
Now that's how it's done and we do it good
Just another day in my loked out hood
So all y'all remember that we can't be stopped
What's the name of my hood? *gunshots*

Summer Breeze,Safe + Sound,1995.0,"Now even though I was only a young buck, I was still trying to kick it
Having a gang of fun and much too young to be wicked
Cause when I was thirteen you know we didn't have cars
It was either double ride the peg nuts or hop on the handle bars
And then we went and bought a gang of balloons and had
A water balloon fight that lasted until the night
Then after that we played some ""Hide and Go Get It""
With the neighborhood homegirls dumb enough to be with it
All in fun and games and keeping it cool
But my my, when you're kicking it, time flies by
Cause every hour's a minute, and every minute's a sec
And if I'd came home late, my moms would ring my neck, yeah
But I regret not them whoopings I got
Cause to be able to play the next day was okay
On a mission, to hit up the neighbor's fruit trees
Just a bunch of kids chillin', enjoying the summer breeze

Summer breeze, flowing like the wind
Boy you need to know that you got a friend
And I'll always be here (I'll always be here)

Now I'm growing some fuzz, getting older like 17 or 18
And the only thing I know is to stay clean
T-shirt, short pants, Nikes on spotless
I was even old enough to buy me a Cutlass
Or a vehicle to ride around town, flirt with the hoes and
Roll down the window and mack to the one who's chosen
Yo, them biker pants look kinda right on you
My name is DJ Quik and my homies is having a barbeque
Before I finish my whole sentence complete
Yo she was off the bus stop and in my passenger seat
And we was sliding to the Westside, stopped at the store
To get some Boones Farm because that make 'em kick it a little more
And at the spot, you know that chicken was kicking
The pig on the grill, and so the day was chill
But that night, my girl was tipsy and was ready to skeeze
But I didn't even trip, too busy jocking the summer breeze


Now I'm 23 and I remember the times when
We was chillin' like villians and didn't have no nines
Like when we used to mob to beaches to kick it and swim
Now I hang around and watch the tides come in
And I'm thinking how many funerals I've been to
Watching all my homies get buried in them boxes they put 'em into
And then I read a letter from upstate
From my homie G-Wayne, who's been locked up since '87, '88
And it really ain't nothing fly about it
So either I'mma stay strong or break down and simply cry about it
And when it seem like things just ain't gon be right
I gotta thank my creator for letting me sleep last night
And waking me up in the morning because I shudder to think
That that could be me dead or locked away in the clink
So I'm lifting my homie's spirits as tall as the trees
And I can even hear him calling me, in the summer breeze",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-summer-breeze-lyrics

Tell me, what do you think of Mister Quik?
What do you mean?
You know, would you like, think he's someone you might wanna fuck?
Yes

It's like ooh-ahh, how you like me now?
Mista Quik up in yo' ass like a dog of puppy chow
'Cause I'm diggy-diggin' the guts out
Then I'm takin' my nuts out
Rinsin' 'em off then I'm up and out
So you tend to think I'm 5'11 but I'm six feet tall
With enough dick to have you climbin' up the wall
One nuts, two nuts, three and four
Then I wake up in the morning and I bust two more
'Cause that's the freak in me, and yes, I'm very doggy
Playin' with your coochie 'til it's nice and soggy
Saddle up the horsey then I ride it West to the North, East and South
And then I put it in your mouth
And shoot a missile. right up where you whistle
Kiss it, lick it
Hoochie mama, you know where to stick it
'Cause if I couldn't fuck, you wouldn't be in my bed
Bitin' on my pillows and bumpin' yo' head
Because, I got the dick you want to know better (that's right)
I've got the nuts that swang together
So here's a promise from me to you
If you ever want to get the bone up and do the grown up
Then we can handle this, baby, just don't get loud
'Cause I'ma cover up your mouth, bitch, while I'm Diggin' U Out

Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that monkey 'til it's funky*

Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Slangin' this dick like dope*

*Fade that money 'til it's funky*

Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Yo D, Hi-C, all up in that shit*

Now I'm wearin' more caps that the fuckin' Mad Hatter
Makin' hoes melt, whether thin or fatter
And if you don't believe me, then it really don't matter
'Cause I'm diggin' it, pullin' it, yankin' it, bringin' the damage to your bladder
And I'm knowin', you knew the job was dangerous when you took it
You played your pussy like bait and let me hook it
So remove your dentures and bob
'Cause it's not just a job, it's an adventure
Dook chute, brown or vanilla, mellow yellow
Color don't matter 'cause I'm not a choosy fellow
As long as I got me a hat
Girl, I can introduce my dog to your cat
'Cause fuckin' is the way of life, my favorite pastime
And I gets happy when I see a panty line
So if I slap that ass, baby doll, don't trip
Just grab yourself a glass full of my dick and take a sip
'Cause God don't make no junk
And he took his time when he shaped your trunk
Plus he made niggas like me, so baby, don't doubt
Let me prove that I'm servin' my purpose, Diggin' U Out

Is this the dick you wanna carry in your mouth?
Little Mista Quiksta, baby, don't knock it
I might be slim but I got a big cock
And if it's worth my while, to naked booty style
Then I'ma put on my uniform and give you service with a smile
Do it 'til you're satisfied
The freak is in the meek, and if you're quiet
Then I know you wanna try it
So go on and unbutton your blouse
'Cause I gotta let you know that DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin' house

Now this is for the G's who know we needs that gangsta shit
It's like the P-Funk we funk so its gotsta hit
And when you fire up that hooter pass it to the young G
The nigga Mista Quik, that's me from the C-to-the-P-to-the-T
And when I'm givin' it up for my hood you can't clown
Cause when we lettin' off you gots to duck down
And then we're rollin' back to the spot where they hang
(Westside fo'hundred street gang)
 so it's a street thang
Makin' that grip and stackin' the chips high
Ballin', never fallin', I gots to stay fly
Whether they smokin' up them 
beadies
 or rollin' the joints fat
I gotta kick it with my niggas cause it's like that
And you need to know I ain't for none, because I'm dumpin'
The hollow point rounds that got everybody humpin'
But niggas they keep on mouthin', kickin' up the static
But keep on talkin' shit and I'mma let you havit

Yeah yeah
Huh, I'mma let you havit
Yeah
Check this

Somebody told me that you dissed me (bitch) in your video
But I ain't trippin cause I'm knowin you ain't nothin but a silly ho
And yeah I said your monkey ass name in my underground tape
But if you peeped game you woulda heard me say
(""To the top of the tree, for C-M-W  to see"")
We wasn't dissin lettin you know the other side was on a mission
Comin up with the Quik-ness, now you know who's dick this is
Down in the throats of the 
Compton's Most Bitchest
So take this shit back to your set if you got one
And I'mma be puttin the double aught bucks in my shotgun
And if you come back fuckin' around I'mma take your life
Why would you come back to a gunfight, with a fuckin knife?
So there it is MC Eiht, cause you're wack
And Mista Quik can beat the niggas down with another sack
So keep on rollin' in your Camry or your Rabbit

If I catch you slippin' in my hood, gotta let you havit

Pet Semetary,The Midnight Life,2014.0," Man Quik, what they talkin' 'bout?
 Man they talkin' 'bout R&B music and Gangsta Rap is dead
 What!? Damn
 Aye, we need to go bury both of them muthafuckaz in the pet semetary
 Take them to Compton and Watts then

I hit the liquor depot, on Crenshaw
Where all the working class G's go
Around the corner from Greg house
On the next block
Knocking something down
'Cause South Central got the best cock
And the flyest bitches live in ran down spots
That's why them niggas be Piruin' and Crippin'
Tryin' to protect that ghetto pussy they hittin'
And you know what you gon' get when you buy you a Quik beat
And you know what's gon' happen your bitches and Quik meet
And I know that she gon' kiss and tell
She can't keep it quiet, can't help it when the dick is swell
Have to admit it, it's just good, she's gotta laugh
Like a parent, I put a whoopin' on her bottom half
I'm a player from the Himalayas
Niggas don't agree, then them niggas' haters
I'm just tryin' to be the R&B savior with the instrumental
Or go down like JFK in a Continental
The most underrated, so mothafuckin' hated
Anything I do for music's never celebrated
Y'all killin' the game like pesticides
But DJ Quik is unpasteurized
My music is flawless, my lyrics is lawless
Your hood wouldn't be eatin', I'm the reason for all this
Y'all tryin' say I got my jaw broke in Compton
What kind of fake gangsta movies y'all be watchin'?
That's some cowboy shit, this some now boy shit
When them rounds hit your car, that's as loud as it's gon' get
Handle my lightweight, get him embalmed in a crate
So don't fuck with the great, you're much safer on skates
On thin ice with lead plates
I'm 'bout to reboot, go on and recruit
Come through and shoot, make 'em scatter like shoop
So all that don't like me, you can suck a dick or somethin'
Turn over on your stomach, take a dildo 'til you vomit
I know you niggas crampin', I know the real you
You keep fuckin' with me, and I'm gon' kill you

Now what they want to go and cancel Arsenio Hall for?
Now we got no place to kick it, that's so uncalled for
I'm a bad motherfucker, 'cause my Glock says so
But my wallet says Gucci, I'm a fly killer, yo
Jewels on your ass, pullin' tools on your ass
Recite a scripture before I put these brrrrs in your ass
I'm a gent, stepped in complected with a bag
Put that in perspective, it's about a half OZ of the OG
Gettin' low key
Rollin' more trees in a hatchback
Chillin' like it's '79
My lyrics so wicked, nigga, go and rewind
So, one more time, I'm from the world's most dangerous city
Back on the scene with no cracks on my screen
I'm like an addict gettin' back on that thing
If R&B is dead, nigga, Rest In Peace
But I'm still gon' write the shit that makes some stress release

Quik is the Name,Quik is the Name,1991.0,"You wanna see a young brother from the Compton tip check a grip
Well keep lookin, because the C-A-M-E-O track is cookin
Like a big ol pot of neckbones, we'll tend to fire up
Because a young brother like the Quik is gettin wired up
You know my offbeat style is flowin all the while
I'm showin suckers, they can't get none of this
Let alone some of this, I'm a musical genius
And if you fuck with my roll {""Face, down, HUT HUT HUT HUT!""}
I beat yo' ass as if we was playin Tecmo Bowl
I'm a producer if a rhythm is dope I choose it
And I hope you know I'd rather be dope than use it
I was a Player in the Penthouse and now I'm uprooted
A young scallion in them khaki suits and booted
With a 40 in hand I'mma take a stand
I'm lettin em know they can't fuck with the one man band
And if a soft sucker wanna know who's to blame
I let 'em know - Quik is the Name
{*scratching and samples*}

Now can we get back on the tip of the real unadulterated funk
This beat is gettin funky just like a skunk
And the funk is that I step with the style I show
Let's blow these motherfuckin nimrods doin low
What makes you think that you can even try to step to me?
I hold the dice without six on the tea leaf
I know you wanna win some go on and try your luck
Punk, put your money on the floor and get bucked
By a pro-fession-al, rhyme hoodlum
Hoochies all over my tip because I screwed 'em
One-time can't lock me up, cause I elude 'em
And bubblegum rappers can't fade me cause I chewed 'em
So suckers get at me I'm the ""Q"" in quotations
And the C-P-T is the location
I won't talk in riddles cause you don't need the strain on your brain
To make it simple - Quik is the Name
{*scratching and samples*}

Yeah, I don't compare my rhyme styles to no gat
Cause to me that bullshit is SUPER wack
I just remain plain and kick the facts
Bout how a nigga can't keep from gettin jacked
You gotta hold your own at any cost
Cause if you don't boy you might get bossed and tossed
By a sucker who claims he got more game than you
Bein true is what you oughta do
Or you just might find some chrome pointed at your dome
Think fast or you might not make it home
See a nigga like myself ain't goin out like that
Because I found that it pays to pack a gat
In the city where surival is a full-time job black
And it ain't givin nuttin back
The fo'-fo'll keep a motherfucker tame
Behind the trigger yo, Quik is the Name

It’z Your Fantasy,Safe + Sound,1995.0,"Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Who taught you how to do this shit?
Yeah, you bad than a motherfucker
Tell me, why are you so curious
And why you keep on starin'
At the motherfuckin' zipper on these jeans
That I'm wearin' cause baby what's in there
Is beyond your wildest dreams
And although it seems that I'm on the nigga ho team
Girl, listen, listen, Mary don't you weep
I don't come cheap and I'm not just no nigga off the street
I'm a certified specialized pro
Who's got a lot of soul when you're swingin'
Off the end of my pole
But the matter at hand is the size
And how it makes ya act
When you get it up and in between your thighs
You could squirm and squeal and try to make a deal
That'll keep me on your jock
For whenever you get that feelin' for the real
And when it gets swollen
You think you'll be controllin' me
Because I put the pole in your hole, see
But however it's done, it's 68 and I owe you 1
I'm doin' it for the thrill of it
So tell me can you feel it?
Chorus:
Itz your fantasy baby, tell me if you feel it
You know you wanna feel it
Itz your fantasy, sing it if you feel it
Okay, let's find a place, somethin' out of dodge
Like the Quality Inn or the Travelodge
Since I'm goin' out of my way
Baby you pay for the spot
See it's only right since you gettin' the cock
Now tell me who's gonna get the rubbers?
First things first, yes I like a bitch
Who carries Lifestyles in her purse
So since you know the play
Close the curtains all the way
And get ready for a toss and some dick sauce
With a little weed I could do a good deed
And as long as you ain't bleedin'
I can give you what you need
But I got a little ritual before we make love
You gotta dish-a-dish-a-scrub
Wash-a-wash-a-wash-a-rinse in the bathtub
Hennessy and apple juice to sip on
Get a little buzzed and we can get our dig on
So don't trip cause when you
Takin' off your clothes to reveal it
I'mma make you feel it
Chorus:
Sing it if ya feel it, itz your fantasy baby
Touch me if ya feel it, I need to know if you feel it
Can you feel it baby?
Now put it where you want it, get in where you fit in
Cause when it comes to hittin' it, splittin' it
I ain't bullshittin'
See, you look so good you make me wanna go bare back on ya
But I ain't hittin' unless I use the whole pack on ya
Bitch didn't ya know I have more stamina than a horse?
So don't trip just let the Hen take it's course
Yeah right now your frontin'
Shy, actin' like you nervous, naw, turnaround, lay down
And let me pound on your cervix
Yeah, it's the Log Ride, like at Magic Mountain
Take it out your mouth and shoot it like a fountain
Pull and watch it explode
Let me change my tire and I'm right back on the road
Now is this more than you expected?
You let me drive that coochie and I wrecked it
So even though I'll never get another chance to kill it
It's cool just as long as I made you feel it
Chorus:
Itz your fantasy, tell me if you feel it
You know you love it, sing it if you feel it
You make me feel it, I know you feel it
You know you feel it, tell me if you feel it
Sing it if you feel it
Yeah, you feel it, I love to make you feel it
Oohh, you feel it",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-itz-your-fantasy-lyrics
We Still Party,Rhythm-al-ism,1998.0,"Ain't no puzzle y'all, we, uh
Groovin off the spirituality, and it feels good
I got somethin to say though

It's time for somebody to take over the West Coast power with fly style, and I'm the one
Been here for years, check your files
'Cause I'm the kinda nigga with a strong desire
To nut up, light a torch, and set the world on fire!
See me bouncin' in my 'Vette
Doin' donuts in the middle of Reseda with Rosarita
Tryna find some place to eat her
'Cause I'm freaky with a capital F
I'll beat up your little pocket pita 'til there ain't nothing left
I'm nasty
See, we gets better when you think we hot
And we got more cheddar than they think we got
You see we make the kinda money that when we withdraw
They notify the feds 'cause it's too much y'all
What you call a stash, we call it petty cash
Spend five or six figures a month. ain't left a gash
Party all night and we sleep all day
Drink Corona X for breakfast then we ready to play
I still like 'em green eyed, big ol' titties and thighs
Big ol' nigga, little heart, and I'm big at the thighs
So shoot your game, baby girl, don't be scared to take a pet
You never know, it just might get wet

We still party, we gets high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, until we die
'Cause life is much too short for you to not be fly

Now whether or not I be drunk off a gallon of Moet
I can still make the beats stink like some salmon croquette
Go to the hood and get all the kids that I can fit
In a limo, take 'em to the store and buy 'em some shit
Give 'em a demo of my new shit 'cause it's the shit
And let 'em know that they the shit
And they can make hits 'cause it ain't shit
I gotta keep the cycle goin'
Baby doll, whichever way the wind be blowin', I'm goin'
Flyer than a motherfucker, Mr. Dante
C'mon, B, back me up each and every day
Whether it's hot, whether it's cold
Whether it's soft, whether it's bold
Whether it's new, whether it's old
Whether it's GOLD, platinum, I stack 'em
Dante, baby doll, we be fly
Freestylin' like a motherfucker, don't ask why
'Cause this ain't Budweiser—""BUD"", ""WEIS"", ""ER""
""Did you see the, thighs on her?""
We nastier than a motherfucker, baby doll
Can I freak your shit, and, break your sugar wall down?
To the compound, uh huh
The elements, feel my elephant, haha

We still party, we gets high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie
So we party, until we die
'Cause life is much too short for you to not be fly

Now did y'all feel that?
See, ain't nothing but God mackin' goin' on right now, see?
The game is to be told and not sold dependin' on which game it is
And we gon' keep it way real, you know?
'Cause it ain't no doubt in nobody's mind that I'm a very blessed individual, man
If we don't turn it around and give it back then we can't go forward, do you feel me?
So that's what we do every time we get on this microphone
We let 'em know that we might be street rappers
But we are very much anointed, and we got somethin' to say
So if you feel me like we feelin' y'all, get yo' ass up on the ball
Time to take this shit back, all of it
'Cause it was ours to begin with
Don't sleep, baby; don't sleep, homey
Now when the hook come back again... (That's what's happenin')

We still party, we gets high
Sometimes we don't feel grown-up and that's no lie

My nigga Hi-C, 2nd II None, AMG
And the Q-U, the new, you knew I could flip it
To any particular groove, I came okay now
Check it if you wanna but it's all in vain
Because my game is still the same - perfection
Feel me as I fill you in
I never rode a pony but I'm Genuine
So give me just a little bit of nicotine, and the sticky green
And I'mma hit her with the icky cream
Boo-yow, I hit her on the neck with the wet
And made the hooker jump without a safety net
Hit the ground, break her back, get up and do it again
Cause she can really take a shot on the chin
Caffeine, cappuccino, chase it with some NoDoz
Up all night like the moon glows, 
searchin' for new hoes
That really wanna follow my lead, indeed
And give a nigga just what I need

The Q-U-I-K is the name I spell
124 beats per minute I rock well
Because I'm tight to the second power when I hit the liquor
And I don't serve emcees, I serve dickers
Bang-bang-boogie when I hit a shot of lugi
And a booger tried to put it on me
But I got bed moves to show her, I float it like Noah
And struck that thigh like a boa
Constrictor when I dicked her down
Now you feel just like a circus, clown when I work this
Jack of all trades, mastered a few
Test these, test these, one, two
Gettin' down with my nigga A-M to the G
In the PM hookers wanna see him
Big cat callin', super fat ballin'
Indeed give us what we need

When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most

Faster than the Concorde, on board, call me the pilot
Baby better let me know she's excited
In a Testarossa, sippin' Mimosas
Girls want me to sign posters
International is the steelo
Got hookers from Cancun to Rio
Flyer than United, boy don't even try it
You can't buy it, got freaks at the Hyatt
Hit the weed up then turn the speed up
The booty from the back's the only way I eat up
Quicker than Jackie Chan
I stretch out the coochie like a rubber band
She wanna be more than the average fan
But the ho needs a job and a man and a retirement plan
So baby don't cry the blues
'Cause I know a gang of hoes in your shoes

Hell yeah. In a real way.
 You know why? Check it out. 
I did everything in my motherfucking power to help you little bitch ass niggas, and y'all wanna talk about me?

I'm just handling my business
Doing what I gotta to stay in this
But the motherfucking pressure is tremendous
All over the world, bitches and ladies wanna fuck us
And niggas be set-tripping 'cause they suck us
On the outside, it's plain to see
That rich and famous is the thang to be
With one-time tripping when they see a nice car
And groupie niggas kissing ass because we stars
Parties in the hotel, parties on the yacht
Parties in the back of my limousine hitting pop
And I don't give fuck that your single's outselling mine
Just give me a fifth of 
Remy Martin
 and I'm fine
But it seems like my crowd's getting smaller (why's that?)
'Cause everybody's jealous of a baller
So when I come up to go back and get the niggas that I used to ride with, they don't know who to side with
And these mark ass niggas in the game
Talking whole shit just to come up with my name
When I catch your asses in person, ain't no hesitation
Just prepare for the motherfucking confrontation
I make you say too much now
Fuck them record it's some dissing, nigga, niggas getting touched now
And the street is where you meet your doom
Nigga I don't think you really wanna hear my gauge go boom

(you know that's right, peeping everyday and every night)
'Cause my shits go BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything and every night)
I said my shit go BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
My shit goes BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)

I grew my motherfucking hair back
To give you niggas something to stare at
'cause you ugly motherfuckers can't wear that style
Just one of many that I've introduced
And you perpetrators know who to defuse
Trying wear feathers
 with them Shirley Temples
Aand gang of bimblers on ya couldn't still with my dimples
Looking just like a fat simile of me
O.G from CPT, Westside, nigga please
Yeah, thanks for the compliment
But can get you get up my shit so I can represent?
And to you punk motherfuckers trying to diss my shit
'Cause the only real master's plan
Is ten Ben Franks folded in my hand
So fuck you and your mark ass clique
You ain't no riders, y'all just bunch of run-and-hiders
Now y'all ain't nothing but a broke down clique
A over-the-hill alcoholic jocking each other's shit
Sold ten records talking about who the hardest and the softest
But there's work at the post office
So don't ever try to get like this
'Cause although you can see me, you can never be me
And your whack-ass career is doomed
'Cause even if your album was the shit you can never go boom

(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
Nigga, You never go BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
You can't blow up you dud, you never go BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
Yes, you never go BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
Let me give ya little bitch ass a break....
Hell yeah...
And it don't stop...
Y'all really don't understand, y'all can't FUCK with me...
Stay down...
I ain't finished...

Now you know you can't saw me
I got the gangsta shit that's making bitches like MC Eiht salty
Yeah, eating his babies mama, skinning and grinning in ya face
I fucked that bitch now tell me how my dick taste
And when you graced that hoe you shoulda salted her
But let me fuck in the same bed with ya daughter
Yeah, the shit that I'm popping is a grit
I know what's fight's worth but since you can't fight
Don't even trip you little scary ass bitch
I heard yo ass cried like Prince when you heard Dollaz + Sense
You losing cool points million down to 76
And what you sound is like your mouth is full of my dick
Geeah, let this be a lesson of what I'm all about
And you better keep my motherfucking name out ya mouth
'Cause it's one in the chamber for every bitch ass nigga up in ya room, and I don't think ya wanna hear 'em go BOOM

(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
My shit goes BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
My shit goes BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)
My shit goes BOOM
(you know that's right, peeping everything every night)",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-boom-lyrics
Niggaz Still Trippin’,Way 2 Fonky,1992.0,"Oh yes I'm rollin around in the fuckin underground
I'm the Q with the E and now it's time to get down
With the fact that I'm back, takin fat stacks
With the macs and the tecs now I can't relax
Like Playa Hamm said, bitches lick the head
Stickin out they tongue, they admittin they sprung
When I cum they cum, and then they get up and run
Cause they know that Quik can stick a hell of a dick
Up in they booty, butt, poop chute, crack
If there's sushi in your coochie then I ain't goin back
Because it ain't nothin worse than a funky cock ho (eww)
You better wash your monkey when we get to the mo-ti-nel
How do you feel, now that you know the real?
You jockin and squealin for the dick I'm dealin
Ain't no simp in my pimpin but for the bitches that nymphin
Quit trippin and stop your pussy from drippin
Because I'm too much for ya, girlie I adore ya
But if you actin hoochie, I might have to floor ya
And then I don't know ya, I fucked the girl before you
And givin you the record to a rubber, you ho
You - cat, I'm floatin like the bomb-ass bud
I won't go pop until I ain't no dug, yeah
And I'm a nigga that's known to clown and get down
And stand up for the underground

Uh, uh, uh, uh
A nigga wit too much dick to fuck with
AMG's got the forty ounce, come and take a sip
Hoes love me cause ""Word to the D"" bumps
Dick for the chick, gun for the chumps
And on tour I got ass and cash
Hit a little bombudd, had a few laughs
State to state, ocean to ocean
Bustin my nuts, while the bus keep coastin
(The king of 40 ounce swing, makin money with my ding-a-ling)
(The bitch's dream) AMG
The owner of the big D, down with 3-0-4 posse
(And hoes I lick and umm, make ya cum)
(And then I get ya sprung) How does it feel to get fucked
Like a pro nigga ho with a dick like a candlestick?
Still have to jump it before you pump it
(I know you're mesmerized by the size)
Once again I'm surrounded by skin
Baby you can have it then, if you can get it in
Cause I got dick for days
Just like the old days... biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch!  D..

Hey bitch!  It's Tha D again
You gotta pay a fee to get freaked again
I hope you didn't think you'd get the dick for free
Because a nigga like Tha D gotta pimp the pussy
So take off your silky drawers
You can 68 me now and owe you 1 to the jaw
Bitch, fuck you once a month, dirty bleedin ass bump
Attractin flies with your female funk
So bitch, you better scrub and wash your bush
And while you're at it, scrape your hoofs, yeah
Cause no one really wants you
See if your feet look clean, your pussy must be clean too
But I don't give a motherfuck
A bitch ain't nuttin but a trick tramp slut, yeah
So get the fuck out my face, cause you're makin me sick
Bitch, cause you smell like sheeit

Stickin to the shit that make 'em jump, make 'em bounce
Make 'em hump, make 'em really wanna get fucked up
Cause it ain't really over 'til it's over
And to me it'll never be, cause I can kick the shit constantly
Right now I'ma hip you to my new debut
Comin up from the underground too
Not a caucausian but a little bigger
So listen to the Funky White Nigga

Aiyyo, this is JFN on my rap to you
Comin through on the underground with my nigga Q
Yeah and I chill and deal {?}
Cause I'm known as the rat, what, so I'ma have ta
Throw a little faster, when y'all witness
The funkiest cuts that are made in the business
So when y'all rollin around
Turn the radio off, hit the underground
Break out your seat, the cops ain't followin
Grab a cold 40 moneygrip and start swallowin
But I ain't drinkin, gimme a pack
Take me to the hood, I know exactly where it's at
ST hit a left at the store
To get some mints for my breath what for (for the bitches)
But on to the underground, and the fat sound
Quik blaze down, originatin in all towns
Bitches always on the tip
And G's, love to roll to our shit
The radio plays, the edit version
For the punk-ass people on the pop excursion
Don't it just make you wanna shake that asspiece
Girls don't hide it, come on and ride it
Get inside here, cause this is the Mothership
And a Funky White Nigga just took you on a trip

And now.. it's the moment you've all been waitin for
Here it comes, the nigga that taught you how to do it froggystyle
It's the ""Skanless"" nigga

Ah ah ah AWW FUCK IT!  Things ain't the same, I've changed
People come around and say ""Damn he's actin strange""
I pop the pussy then I bail
Bitch don't trip, cause you'll make me tell
'bout the niggas you fucked, the dicks you sucked
The nuts you bust so don't fuck with us
Check it baby, yo' best bet's to bone out
Cause youse a tramp, with a cramp in ya mouth
And your boyfriend got a dick like a gummy worm
With blanks in his balls, no sperm
I'm Hi-C, no need to rush
Take my dick, and treat it like a toothbrush
{tch tch, tch tch} All up by your gums
(tch tch tch} So I can cum
When I do, yo it's time to rinse
Floss {*gargling*} spit the sperm out your mouth!

Ghetto Rendezvous,The Book of David,2011.0,"Rendezvous, I guess it's time for another
Aww look what you muthafuckas done went and did
Y'all done pissed off
Yeah what up sis, I hear you out there
You know you done fucked up
I'm glad y'all set it off

You prolly mad 'cause you can't eat off me no more
Don't wanna hear you crying or offer you no dough
You tried to make my life shabby
With the zodiac sign of the cancer you crabby
Plus you got away with murder twice
Just like that nigga that's on thin ice

I hate you so much it just shows
I hate you more than Michael hated Joe
And your son looks like a fucking Al-Qaeda
I'mma call him Whop Daddy cause his chin to the side
Now that's the mark of the beast
You had a Damien in 1977 to say the least
Your house is full of mole, body full of yeast
I bet you baking a loaf of bread down between your cheeks
You stanky little rodent, yeah bitch, you molded
You'll never see your brother, that's why your love carroded
Emphysema all in him
You can't hold nobody, there ain't no toxins in your venom
You just a grand momma in denim
Looking for some little kids to put some shit up in them

The problem is you ain't have no fucking loyalty
And the only thing you wanted was my royalties
You stole a car and a bike from me
Looking back I was the caretaker of a dummy
And that husband of yours, you dumb witch
Was still a husband of hers you stupid bitch
You never acted your age
You only came to embarrass me out in public for days
That's why little clarity pays
You got the boot
Now I'm chipping like Frito Lays
Rest in peace to my niece, Elise
When she was lying in state, she had a grin on her mouthpiece
Now what that tell you about you
You disturb to the curb, and it's better without you

Fat boy know you really been dumming
Going over peewee house showing off your triple stomach
With a strap in your waist
Now what you gon do when you see my face, I doubt it
I'm tired of playing with you cocka roaches
I gave you bitches life and trust and you stupids broke it
Cause you a muthafuckin sex offender
Put some honey on your dick and put it in a blender
They caught you fucking on your sister's daughter
That some incestual shit, get the holy water
Compton Alumni, a-no go
Nigga you really Pasa Robles
Upstate in Y.A. Without your homeboys
Cheeking each other butts making no noise

If I bought you equipment and you sold it, that's on you
Help you get into a home and lose it, that's on you
You niggas acting like babies
You feeling entitled to another man's money, that's crazy
More like insane, schizophrenia
Struggles with love and money and happiness you get plenty of
While I'm staying fly like laguardia
I'm a guardian, I'm the auditor
I'm the flyiest mc that you ever heard
On the Norman microphone, motherfucker that's word
Now give me the mic and let me be heard
Cause I be quitting surely, I am the shep-herd
Now what you know about my lyrics and style
I got a Clicquot backwash, fly spit, we wild",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-ghetto-rendezvous-lyrics
50 Ways,Under Tha Influence,2002.0,"Why you keep givin me cards I can't keep?
I throw these two back, you throw me two more, they're so cheap
I couldn't get the winning hand that I wanted in my sleep
Cause when the dream get good, I get trampled by sheep
Nightmares, even when I'm walkin in day
I'm havin dreams that I'm runnin but there's smoke in the way
And there's this man in a suit, he take a toke and he say
""You have a promise that you made and you broke it today.""
Now which part of this movie here did I just miss?
Did I really sell my soul to this big red bitch?
I don't think what you got to offer is really enough
For cars sex and houses, money and stuff
I'd rather be broke and own nothin but peace of mind
And a Benz, and a house, and a nine-deuce-nine
Oh Top, help me out before I sink the boat
There's gotta be more than 50 ways to keep afloat
Cause I feel like I'm suffocatin, I can't breathe
I wanna go, but I'm too afraid to leave
Take me with you Mausie, I know you're seein somethin grand
As you fade away, and you gently release my hand
And it shook my balance, cause you ain't no more alive
You think I'd see you, if I drink this 45?
Oh I'd be the first person poppin three, droppin me
To the abyss, but I miss, what's stoppin me?
I got the pressures of the WORLD on my little back
My nerves are turnin into jelly and I'm bout to crack
You think I'm cheatin on my homies, by holdin back?
No I really protect them all because the truth is wack
Forever bars and forever scars
Bein trapped and dyin young makes forever stars
Tell me why am I so hesitant?
And the way life's goin, looks like when hell comes, I'mma be a resident

La, la la-la - la, la la-la
La, la la-la - la, la la-la

They tell me Quik, suck it up, I'm supposed to
But me and Mausberg was closer than most knew
It ain't dramatized, and it ain't a fuckin act
When you're traumatized, and it ain't no turnin back
When you're so connected, and it's hard to keep your focus
When you're so affected, and it's hard to love again
When you're so neglected - suck it up, I'm 'posed to
That ain't easy for somebody you're close to, shit
See your homey in a coffin is so wicked and vivid
It's gon' be harder on all of us, cause we gon' relive it
Over and over, drunk or sober, from October to October
I steadily feel like I'm gettin knocked over
And all the money in the world, don't make it better
And a whole bottle of alcohol, don't make it wetter
With a blur and a slur I'm still callin ya name (Tog Dog)
And on top of this drama you add fame? Wild
But when you start to bubble then your friends they spite you
And if you go to church, then hip-hop won't like you
I feel like a giant on a worldwide stage
But at the same time trapped in a real tight cage
With no way out, I play out, then I come back
Cause there's an unwritten law that says I can't be wack
So I put on my game face, go back to the same place
Only to realize that y'all ain't got the same taste
Even with somethin new, they look at you cold
And without a hot face, consider you old
And leavin me stressed and broken-hearted
How could I be finished with West coast rap? I helped start it!",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-50-ways-lyrics

And a one and a two and a three
And you got the nigga AMG
And a four and a five and a six
On my left hand side is DJ Quik
We got 2nd II None in the house
We got my man Hi-C in the house

And show you how the real jackers jack, nigga

I keep the 44 Mag in a duffle bag
And in the G-ride I'm rollin' in the rain
And don't let me catch you slippin' on the turning lane
I creep up to your quarter panel and I pause
Whip out the 4 up to your nose and make you shit your drawers
Now I don't want your money or your hoes
No, all I want is your muthafuckin

Now, let's take a ride down to

I'm rollin with a muthafucka with doodoo in his pants
And a nigga like you can get me work
Because I know you got them birdies that don't chirp
Aww, too bad you didn't make it to your .9
So forget about your Fin-O 'cause it's mine
And to you niggas that be trippin, watch your trunk and don't be slippin
'Cause the Quik will take your hoopty every time, muthafucka

Once again it's the muthafuckin D

You wanna get quoted, get your ass in the circle

And I'm about to bust a nut on your little baby's head
The shit you be talking, I label it ""caca""
Move your fat ass, and pass the vodka
Pour half a cup, fill it up with Socco
Bitches try and trip, you might get socked, ho
""I love you, though,"" that's what I'm screamin'

And when I play this guitar, it's goin' make my dick hard
Something like the Scarecrow, Michael Jackson, fuck the Wizard
I should have gone Gilliard, bipolar is Julliard
Either extreme, I'll kill you motherfuckers on the schoolyard
Checks off, inbound — watch the Quiksta get down
I hate a hacker — hacky players need to go back, sit down
'Cause if you ain't with the now, that makes you way back when
And you can keep all of that retro-dated action
Now get up on my time zone, quit workin' with limestones
Switch that shit for marble and granite

Had to let the windows down, you know the crown
The all black White Sox hat, it's goin' down
Take a nigga shoppin' or somethin', don't be frontin'
Told everybody we datin', no we wasn't
We was just havin' some fun, then you tripped
Talkin' that relationship shit, then I dipped
Went to the studio, quick, Got with Quik
Told him 'let me get a 16', made a hit
The O.P.M. money, legit, I keep countin'
Last week I made ten records off three ounces
I'ma need a house with a view and like three fountains
Just a little something for my niggas to keep bouncin'
Uh, 'cause we don't dance much
I still sag and pull my pants up
Aye, y'all should start doin' stand up
You sold records, pull them scans up
Aye, said my niggas pull them vans up
Aye, now you niggas understand us
Yeah, DJ Quik hooked the jam up
Sound like he hooked the band up
Suga Free, I'm a fan, bruh
Aye, damn, this finna fuck the land up
Uh — 'cause it'll never stop
Your style is like lemonade, it'll never pop
Every time you on TV, I don't never watch

But I still create the shit that the brothers relate to
Cause it's simple, but I'm no simp, I'm lettin you have it
To the temple leavin a scar MUCH bigger than a, pimple
You want the rubber from a gangsta boot to your grill?
Come take a ride with me and witness the thrill
Of an ass-whuppin, issued by the brothers in the khaki pants
Some think I'm too light to fight, so then they'll win but I grin
When I sail to your motherfuckin chin (MMM)
So suckers keep walkin until the po-po is talkin
In plain simple english; no wait in plain simple slang, no jivin
Fuckin with me is more lethal than drinkin and drivin
Or try to figure the flow I deliver
Punk it makes you shiver when you think I'm takin two to your liver
The D-to-the-E-to-the-motherfuckin-A with a vengeance
A side of Quik that you ain't never experiencin
I'm stutter steppin with crap on the low and I flow well
Intensifyin with every line, cause I show and tell
My backup is backin, never leavin me lackin
With Double or Nothin, KK, D, and AMG and we're stackin
Up shells - for motherfuckers just like you

And watch you just fold up
It's Tha D in the back with the strap
Down for some shit with a bitch in my lap
Punk motherfuckers like to play the brave role
But I don't give a fuck, you can still get T-rolled
It ain't like you never been checked befo'
You stupid nigga, your bitch, your ho
The motherfuckers rollin the backstreets
Not givin a fuck, because we roll too motherfuckin deep
""(How deep?)""

Deeper than the crack in your momma's cock
Too deep for a nigga, now I can't stop
Cause niggas'll roll deep, deep in the middle of the street
So deep we roll onto next week
Two's and fo's, that nigga K throws heavy blows
Heavy enough to knock the snot out of niggas nose
Cause niggas ain't nothin but head and shoulders
Fuck pellets nigga, we shootin' boulders
And I'mma roll, cause I'm doin my own thing

For those who wanna sleep, time to creep
Straight up fools, cause niggas is rollin deep

Fuck a one-time jack, I eenie meenie miney wet the hoes
Back in the alley I be rollin on the pimpin mode
Unfadeable, cause I'm D-double-E-P

And hoes wanna ho, with a niggerole like so
And after I trick, yo see you later bitch!
And niggas think they know what they talkin bout, whatchu sayin?
It was your bitch, that I was fuckin layin and playin
So, if she was fine don't be denyin that I did her
Trust your data nigga, and let my dick get with her
Because another motherfuckin gangster's strollin yo

Ha ha nothin but the best,from the best
You feel me? hear me
This is dedicated to that special someone
You know who you are, and you never gave me a chance
I used to watch you walk to class,fine as can be
While I'm standing here with K.K. and D
And I did a liitle bit of everything just to get your attention
But I knew you had no eyes for me
I used to get up, sharpen my pencil for nothin
You watch me watch you rollin your eyes and you still was bumpin
So when test time came I was all in yours
With no bubbles on my papers just some low ass scores
I guess you can call it puppy love I was a scrub
Having fantasies of me and you up in my tub
Makin love in the soapy water,having my daughter
But I knew you liked them baller dudes and, I did'nt have a quarter
I admit on the rainy days it was sad
Cause it was'nt about who you was but what you had
Now I'm doing swell baby and you know it's true
Back when you had a chance you should've let me breath on you
(Chorus)
Sittin in my room thinkin bout you
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin
I'm Sittin in my room thinkin bout you
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin
Now I called you on the telephone baby it's david
The last you gave a chance is the first to save it
And I'm just tryin to hook us up for another session
Because I have'nt learned my lesson
Plus I got positions never ending
Now I'm descending down into your valley baby work your tendons
Doing what I do to make you do what you did
To make me come so hard that we almost had a kid
Platinum Thats how I descibe your thigh
Tell me how come your so young doin shit that fly
You must have came from the school of hard knocks
Lickin on hard rocks and blowin off tube socks
Now whenever it's time for fun
You got me blowin up your pager with 911's ha
Now show me a little affection
But hurry up before I lose my erection
(Chorus)
Because I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin
I said I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin

And now I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you
And you baby doll don't even have a clue
I'm just sittin in my spa thinkin thinkin bout you

And I'm doin rather swell in ???? heaven yeah it's true

Keep Tha ‘P’ in It,Safe + Sound,1995.0,"-Ay, ay, ay, Topsaw; ay, Topsaw
-Ay man, what is it, man?
-Who on the record, man?
-Man, who the hell are you, man? Walkin' up on me lookin' like you so broke, man, if it cost three cents to shit you'd have to throw up. You know who on the record. Man, why don't you sit your ignorant ass down, man, and listen...

So is it my turn again? (Yeah nigga it's yours)
Oh, I can kick a funky verse for the P-Funk? (Of course)
Well, countdown nigga to the end for these fakers
Bet we hit this time and we fadin' all takers
Who'da thunk the funk was this potent out the Westside
Not be along for the ride (But it's only for the trues)
That's right, so peep the shot
And if I get it hot, baby I'ma rock the twat
'Cause ain't no party like a party in the Penthouse suite
And you know how we do it, baby, yo Tree
So if the mackin-est mack brings fear to them perpetrators frontin', they was cowards from the very start
Pretendin' theys the ones that trues
But pimp, who was they foolin'? (Not me or you)
Fools confused, thinking we's on a decline
'Cause we keeps the P's. Ain't it true, Dr. Funkenstein?

*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

Comin' at that ass again it don't stop
Bust a lean in yo' 6-4 Chev, take a hop to the top
Where the hustlas hang out
Indo remains to sprout and sell knows what I'm talking about
And gets hoes from my block to your neighborhood
Tell 'em, Quik, when you know he's back to no good
I wish you would, 'cause I'm true to this gangsta shit
I took a Tic Tac, and tossed 'em like a hoe in the hood bitch
Shoot my ends, hoe
They say it's never enough, you know?
I gots to have mo'
But I'ma shake the spot, in fact
I just jacked his trick and his fo' so I can cut the 'Lac
And straight P-Funk anytime
It's only right you peeped the rhyme, I gots to take mine
Check yo' ass with the shit that stank
'Cause 2-Tone came to the game, ain't a damn thang changed

*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed

Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

Well, it's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4
And I thought you knew the drill, but you still don't hear me though
KAM and Watts Up from the grass roots
No daisy duke shit, knockin' crazy ass boots
Nigga please, we kick it like G's
Puttin' down work, when I lurk, don't even sneeze (up the gold D's)
That's just the Eastside way of getting chips
When you're raised up dealin' with the dogs and the 'rips
New cars get tagged, lowriders get wrecked
Niggas caps get peeled back, and chins get checked
Don't expect no love or no apology
The kids ain't fallin' for your child psychology
In 9 and 4 mindin' yo' business is the best bet
Screamin 'Watts riot' and we ain't even made a mess yet
You shouldn't speak with a weak heart
You gots to finish everything you start
And ain't a damn thang changed

*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

Now niggas transform like decepticons
We'll slice your ass up like Jeffrey Dahm...
Quik drop bombs on the P-Funk tip
Even though a nigga rap you'll still get that ass whipped
Please don't slip, ain't a damn than changed
Numb yo' ass up like some novocaine
Have you all fucked up like you smoked some loop
Hi-C still sippin' pussy like soup
We got Kam, Hamm, Nookie, and Quik
And me myself, mister big dick
Now I might not know which bitch that I want
But I know on thing I *scratch* 
From ya speaker and not from ya ass
'Cause some of y'all bitches just won't take baths
Half-head niggas cannot be tamed
'Cause we true to the game
And ain't a damn thang changed

*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

Can ya tell me? (Who that nigga be?)
Goddamn, muthafucka, it's the Gangsta D
Kickin' shit for these niggas and all these bad necks
'Cause I got the dope shit for each and every set
Next..

Up on line it's that BlaKKazz K
I could never switch up ya 'cause I'm still the same way
Me and D can flip the shit, kick down a funky flow
We represent the (P-Funk)
You know what it stand for

Now back up in yo' ass again, it's Mister Quik and I clowns
I got the shit that shake 'em down, break 'em down, take 'em down
And now that I'm
Chillin' with my niggas Mister 2-Tone, 2nd II None, Playa Hamm and Kam
Well goddamn
Doin' it like we do it, ain't nuttin' but trues to it
Rollin' with the funky 'P' I thought you knew it
'Cause it's nothin' but the best
For the trues from the West...Side
'Cause ain't nuttin' changed and you know that's right

Yeah, this is General Jeff
Bringin' up the rear
Lettin' ya know we representin' with an all-star line up for that ass
Peep this out
We got Quik, 2nd II None, Hi-C, Playa Hamm, 2-Tone and that nigga Kam
If that don't move your ass I don't know what will
But no matter what, you gots to keep the P in it

Puffin’ the Dragon,The Midnight Life,2014.0,"To whom are concerned
Don't take me vain
I plowed a hard road for people like Lil' Wayne
I put it all in place
To have it taken away
And live in ridicule and grief, dismay
Before my face got stubble
My house burned to rubble
The party that I planned for the world got me in trouble
Journalists asked what I did with my money
I gave it to the needy
Not that greedy,
 I'm Quik
I do it like I wanna'
Something like the South of France
I want to hear the thunder
Now open up the ceiling, ask the valet
Pull the roof off
I want to feel the feeling
So let the raindrops kiss me on my Angelic face
I'm such a sport, had to ask the turtle
Was it a race?
And now I yield for the snail's pace
Cross town traffic in a haze
I love this place

I'm up and I'm at it
I guess I'm just a musical addict
I like it when my life is automatic
I'm summoning Magic
I gotta avoid it when its tragic
So call me when you need a new gadget
I'm puffin 
the dragon
It's fried chicken in back of the wagon
Mercedes, Lamborghini we draggin
On the Interstate 15 to Vegas
We drunk and we niggas
They pay us, We playas

Betrayed to the point where i pop my trunk
But why me?
Go to prison and send heaven a punk
I was the star of the show
But that turns your friends against you
Hence, they'll never get another opportunity since you
Salon shop talk now, Days are jaded
They ask a thousand questions
While im getting my hair braided
Staring at me funny
Counting one dollar bills
Greed is a sin but ignorance kills
And LA can be a very cold place at times
Alot of different drugs
No universal mind
On the same page of alot of different books
I swear that this could be as fun as it looks
Cause when you ride em right
You get the fun in the sun
But if you stab the horse, you’re infamous
Got one and your done
On the surface its calm
The naked eye can't see it
But the undercurrents there
To steal a body if needed
So be it

I'm up and I'm at it
I guess I'm just a musical addict
I like it when my life is automatic
I'm summoning Magic
I gotta avoid it when its tragic
So call me when you need a new gadget
I'm puffin 
the dragon
It's fried chicken in back of the wagon
Mercedes, Lamborghini we draggin
On the Interstate 15 to Vegas
We drunk and we niggas
They pay us, We playas

Rose Hills filling up with all of my friends
Emotions I can't show em
Im just keeping it in
Got alot of living to do
Avoiding the laws of the land
The grim reaper got the scythe in his hand
So its party on the stage
While playing everything
Scratch the record
Throw my hands up
Make everybody sing
Still the one man band
Still a Hip-Hop fan
A producer from Old Spruce
But  with a mic and a band
Im not as passionate about it
But i hit now and then
Not naive to envy that fills the hearts of men
Im a G from the streets
But i need a new letter
One that  announces my power and describes me better
Im a Q from a composition writer
I see it all in high lighter
From the perspective of a biter
So Drake I owe you a line and Diddy you too
Canada, New York and Compton lets get a brew

I'm up and I'm at it
I guess I'm just a musical addict
I like it when my life is automatic
I'm summoning Magic
I gotta avoid it when its tragic
So call me when you need a new gadget
I'm puffin

8 Ball,Quik is the Name,1991.0,"Pass me the... (8 Ball) so I can get fucked up
My name is DJ Quik, so yo, what's up?
Cause I'm the baddest, I feel, gettin ill for real
With a Forty of O.E., yo, you know the deal
I'm just chillin with a Forty in hand
I'm so damn bent, that I can hardly stand
The bottle's in my face, and my lips are all around it
So stand to the side and watch me (down it)
Take it to the head without feeling no guilt
If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with me when I'm on tilt
Cause I'm a funky dope brother who just won't stop
And I like to drink the 8, cause it's good till the last drop
If I can't get it, then I get the discouraged
I gotta get a bottle of that liquid courage
I take a big gulp, and my head starts zoomin
But I'm feeling good as hell, so let the bass keep boomin
I'm DJ Quik, and the shots I'm callin
But the posse don't mind, cause we all 8-Ballin
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(Take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 Ball)

That vodka I was drinkin said, ""Dude, go 'head""

Now a Forty only cost about $1.95
So we finna mob 17 to the liquor store
And get a case, fuck a six-pack, what's that?
I don't drink no St. Ides, so forget that
Now one nigga said that Bull got pull
Just drink a quart of O.E. and your ass'll be full
And if you don't think O.E. be workin
Then fuck it, bust the irkin and jerkin
Cause I'm a muthafucka that think when I wanna drink
And how can I tell that you're drunk? Cause your breath stink
I know you know you need some double-mint
And you can't mack to a bitch when you're too bent
So take it from me, the homie DJ Quik
You better rush your cooler, cause you might be sick
Cause the 8 is for the true niggas, and the grown-ups
But that don't matter, cause Quik got it sowed up
And punk muthafuckas wanna squab and all that
But we can get em up as soon as you pass the...
(8 Ball)

(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)

Pass me the

(Fuck it up, y'all)
(And here comes the...)

(It'll have you trippin)
(Party)
(Cause I was drunk)
(Ah yeah)
Right about now I'm wonderin who else gone off that 8 Ball besides myself
You know all the homies goin off of it
And I know
The L.A. Posse's goin off of that (8 Ball)
And G Wayne goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Donzelli goin off of that (8 Ball)
My homie Shot is goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Playa Hamm goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Shabby Blue goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Mike P goin off of that (8 Ball)
And N.O.E. is goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Little Shawn goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Big Duck goin off of that (8 Ball)

Tanqueray,Safe + Sound,1995.0,"Huh, now don't come to my party if you don't wanna get drunk
It's me and my niggas and we puffin on the skunk
'Cause it's true when I'm bent and I'm fuckin I can last long
With some Gin and a grin 'cause I'm cock strong
Now don't trip ho, you like to get bent too
Hit the Thai, run, get ya coochie run up in too
By a nigga that'll make ya sick
You know me *scratch**scratch**scratch* , Yeah
Now let me tell you about a party that I threw last year
Niggas kept hollerin' that ""Party over here""
Too many niggas so I had to get a keg of Budweiser
But it had me pissin' down my leg
So I bought somethin' that'll last longer
Somethin' a little harder, somethin' a little stronger
Somethin' that'll definitely make your day
So what you say muthafucka, want some Tanqueray?
Now the niggas up on it went got some orange juice
'Cause they know that Tanqueray'll get them hoes loose
Fillin' up your glass, boy, you tryin' to trip
Nigga, you can't have no full glass, fool, take a sip
But I'm not stingy so I filled it to the rim
He went up in my kitchen with a bitch named Kim
Straight bareback in the pussy he dove
Huh, bustin' nuts all on my stove
From drinking that..

Tanqueray'll have ya feelin' so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big ol' way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

Now the party started jumpin' and the music got loud
A hand full of niggas done turn into a crowd
Out of my control, the party started hoppin'
And the more that niggas drunk, the more that started droppin
Shit, my house got fucked up for certain
With beer on my carpet, gum on my curtain
Niggas in my front yard bendin' up the fence
Havin' a fuckin' great time all at my expense
But I can't trip because I'm knowin'
Niggas gon' be niggas and that's just the way shit's goin'
But 'bout damn time I got a visit from the crew
Playa Hamm and Shabby Bleu
With some bitches hollerin' (Hey, where the party at?)
I said ""The party's in my pants if ya monkey's kinda fat""
""Naw, I'm just bullshittin', come on in""
Now it was two bad bitches, but they had an ugly friend
Then the ho decided that she wanted to dance
Spilled Boone's Farm, all on my pants
Plus she was funky like a Figuero' ho
But I didn't say a goddamn thing 'cause I didn't know
Then she a trip and started havin' a fit
Talking about (All y'all rappin' niggas ain't shit)
So I spit in her face and socked the ho in lip
And dragged the bitch outta my tip
'Cause I was full of that..

Tanqueray'll have ya feelin' so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big ol' way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

Check it
Now the bitch straight skated, but then she rolled back
Came up in my party wit a strap, cocked it
Jack, spotted it, hit her on the head and speedknotted it
Bitch dropped the strap and I got it
Rat pack time, niggas, stop
The lights came on and the bitch got dropped
It was party over here and party over there
'Til the niggas tripped and started pullin' out her hair
Now, it really wasn't nice to see
When they beat the bitch down, and drag her ass out in the street
And you ain't getting your gat back, shawty
Put it in my pocket, went back to the party
And everybody kicked it for the rest of the night
Huh, bud straight fazin' and the vibes was right
Wasn't no more scrappin', everything was okay
'Til everybody up and skated 'cause we was outta that..

Tanqueray'll have ya feelin' so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big ol' way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

'Cause slanging them funky ass tracks is what I'm doin'
(Yo, DJ Quik, what time is it?)
It's time to show the homies I can make another hit
Another bomb ass cut and another 10 dollar tape
In the pen, they gettin' swoll and on the outs, they steady rollin' on my shit
'Cause they know that Quik will never quit
I’m not an N.W.A, I ain’t yet, I’m on my way
To the top of the tree, for C.M.W. to see

And we be kicking it, Genuine Draft in my clutch

And then I'm out, fading all them niggas with no hope
Who just got a taste of the real doe


So you say you want doe, here's a mothafucking hit
(Yeah, boy, I like that shit)
Now back to my goodie old good note
I'm getting sweated 'cause I roll with the good doe
You wanna get a little taste?
Bitch, 10 dollars for a mothafucking tape
And if you try to snatch my stash
I'm gonna beat your Black monkey ass
Give me the pipe, 'cause that ain't right
Look at you, nigga, you been up all night
You say you want a true high?
You say you wanna get fucked up
Here's a proper blast
(Now go on with your funky ass)
And tell the rest of your folks
That the D and the fellas got the bomb ass doe


Take a taste of the real
The D-O-P-E doe, now the deal
You know some niggas can't cope with the K
I'm shaking the dice and leaving them broke
It was your last hope, so what you do is croak
You smelled the smoke, you choke, 'cause I'm unfadeable
It was the note I wrote that made it playable
So take a quote, now write it, because I stay able
Yeah, the K is goddamn able to rock a mic
Straight out, you know I'm destined, who want to light
The pipe, I got the Russian, I know I'm right
(We know) I couldn't trust them
With the pureness of the doe because it's not chest-bustin'
I'm the K, straight from 2nd II None
And if you wanna get some
Take a chance, come with a cut rope
You know you can't hang with a hit from the real doe


You know it's funky, funky, funky, I love a fat monkey
I rap for the niggas, and steal from the honkies
And hoes want the autograph, but I start to laugh
'Cause you used to ignore me, but now you adore me
'Cause bitch, you's a mothafucking trick
Only out for the AMG's dick
Girl, I got paid, now I got it made
Put your money where your mouth is, fuck, take a suck
'Cause I know (I know), I know (I know)
You's a big freak, so open sesame
And let me pop the pill, show you how I feel
Nut in your butt and all that stuff
'Cause the vertical joyride's taking off
I got my ticket, ho, so show me where to go
And play me like a good old guitar
Let me be your rock star with the real doe",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-real-doe-lyrics
Well,Balance & Options,2000.0,"Now if I broke my leg, tell me, would I be carried?
And would you still love, baby, if I was married?
Or will I make the shot even if I was hurried?
And will I still be remembered even after I'm buried?
They got me waking up in the morning getting loaded
Got me worrying so hard sometimes I'm feeling like my brain exploded
But I'm a break it down, fix it and re-roll it
And show you haters out here that I control it
I'm in this for something so different that you couldn't imagine
The style, the flyness, the beautiful hoes
The pile, the higness, the pitiful lows
That keeps a major player like me up on his toes
No, not quite, I want my props on the merit of the hands
That I use to mould myself to the spirit of a man
I'm just a tiny grain of sand under my God
The one who keeps me humble, keeps me up and working hard
It's alright to be in love with yourself
But when your sex life gets bad you ain't on the shelf
Lose your addictions, clean spirit's a must
Shed your inhibitions and come bounce with us
We trying to have fun from Japan to Compton
With no more evil cause it salts the program
See I never went back to something that burned out
And I ain't never did a party I ain't turn out

Things I used to do, I don't do no more
Places I used to go, don't move me like before
Ahh, but it's gonna be rough

]From the bottom to the top, top to the bottom
Real homeys don't forget about the ones who thought about em
Rags to riches, riches to rags
I apologize for hurting your feelings, little fag
Back in the day we was young thinking everything was cool
Ditching school, puffing beadies and drinking brew
Afraid of the bomb izm but we tried it
Ain't no sense in denying it, I loved that environment
Take a look back and damn near shed a tear
Reminiscing on the past time, year after year
When we grew up, things have changed
You in the penitentiary, I be dwelling in the rap game
Started at the same path but I chose to go right
Looking for money and fame cause I'm a rider for life
And all the slanging and banging and fucking rats in the past
I shook it to the left and I ain't looking for a pass


Now I just want to do my best whether it's work, play or either
And I ain't trying to be no preacher cause they ain't perfect neither
One of the coldest entertainers that I done seen yet
With the skill to rock the fellas and make the ladies sweat
But there's a method to the madness that I suffer from
Making the hardest dudes tremble and even tougher run
It's called the spirit and it's fly, and it's making me bigger
Keeping me from stressing out and throwing nuttys on niggas
Ain't religion for me unless it's all to the good
Cause I'm an open-minded ex-G with my sights on the hood
Trying to keep the little YGs out of the line of the fire
Even if it means I'm gonna take the hit, leak and expire
Now I see what Top was saying before he left his hole
That we'll shine like glitter, my nigga, but keep your soul
Don't give another nigga control of your gold
Share your parties with the world and watch you get swirled",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-well-lyrics
Luv of My Life,The Book of David,2011.0,"I'm Looking for the love of my life
Lil drank, lil stank, that's the love of my life
Not looking for a hussy trying to be my wife
Say I'm looking for the cash, that's the love of my life
I'm looking for the love, the love of my life
Lil drank, lil stank that's the love of my life
Not looking for a broad trying to be my wife
Say I'm looking for a whip, that's the love of my life

Now with a driver I can drink like I'm off the bottle
Martini glass filling, that's off the top
Don't like the talk shop, I'd rather shop and talk
I treat the tags like I treat them clubs, pop em off
A lot of players got the game distorted
If you have to ask how much it cost you can't afford it
Plain and simple cut and dry, right to the chase
Cause sometimes you gotta put them ig-ums in they place
Everybody can't make it to the pros
Some rise to the top, others down low
Some ride in the drops, others just drove
That's the way the water flows, if it ain't froze
Look at the brain on the man quick as the dame
Get the game from my mind to the pin through my hand
And to the streets from the speakers to the mike
That's why I'm so materialistic
I'm tryna buy the love right


Panamera Porsche, Maserati copy painting
Diamonds from Chris Aire, too awesome ain't it
Middle finger in the air for the disses
And Tiffany jewelry for the misses
Orange bottle champagne teal green blue
Clicko and Dom Perignon, weed too
Turn the music up so loud it bleed through
The bang out that's exactly what he do
He get his style from the city of Compton
Fuck the doorbell, he get to knocking on something
Whip out on these haters get the blocking on something
Take my girl home and get to locking on something or something
Yeah, that's my ghetto mentality
I made it reality and it made me a salary
So I know just why you haters are mad at me
My life is a strategy, while your life is a tragedy
So I'm looking


I'm looking for the new love of my life
Benz CL63 all tan and with the insides
Color of beach sand, it's such a beautiful sight Just like Amber Rose
The way she sits at the light hit a pose
I let her pause for the cause, camera shows
50k watch just so they go
Jury go bananas so they go apes
I'm making love to the money like a sex tape
I travel onward, on to the next state
Making that big cake but no wedding date
I'm so hood rich, and love to cash out
And tear malls down, yeah, spas out
And throw it in the bags and bring bags out
Full throttle whips, yeah smash out
Newest space for my house got another house
I gotta make money",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-luv-of-my-life-lyrics

Because I knock so many boots I have to keep 'em in stacks
Now the fellas they get jealous, the ladies they get hot
Because they now that I'm player givin you all that I got
And in the sheets I'm a super lover that's what I said
I maybe Quik on the tables but I'm forever in bed
Because I grind it, and get behind it
And when my tape stops I get up and rewind it
I like to fuck it, I never suck it
And if you're dumb I get you sprung just like a cluck
Bitch, hey, DJ Quik is in effect for the 9-0 season
Skeasin is the reason, cus I'm so damn pleasin
Quik is the name and if you think that I'm appealin
Then go for what you know, baby, because I got that feelin

Yo man I see what your sayin man

Yea mother fuckers...

Right about now we 'bout to let you know that Compton's in the mother fuckin' house
I got my nigga J??? in this mother fucka
And my road dog K.K. hah
We finna put niggas to sleep in that 400 3
Check it

Yeah, mother fucka
Right back on yo' ass
I hid in the bushes and I crept up through the grass
What you running from bitch? You fake Irish faggot
You got a big booty 
Everlast
, let me tag it
Cause you look like a woman, but you try to clown
I kicked you in your ass, that's why you 
Jump Around

So don't try to fuck with a Compton nigga
And I'mma tell you who's daddy 'fore I pull the trigger
Now Daddy is the nigga getting head from your mommy
Daddy is the nigga with a gun like a Tommy
Daddy is the nigga that you wanna be like
And Daddy is the nigga with your shit on his Nikes
So don't be scared, just be prepared
For when you diss a nigga that you won't be spared
Little white boy, how the fuck you figure?
No, you can't fuck with a nigga

Can't fuck with a nigga...
Nigga you wanna fade me?
One... killer...
Fool you're crazy
Can't fuck with a nigga..
Mother fuckers just like you
You better step 'fore I beat you with a switch
Can't fuck with a nigga...
Nigga you wanna fade me?
One... killer...
Fool you're crazy
Can't fuck with a nigga..
Mother fuckers just like you
And.. And you better step 'fore I beat you with a switch

Now there's a certain type of nigga that can make you sick
Mother fuckin' booty and ain't saying shit
What you'll have to start a-steppin', you ain't got no style
Your white is showing like Valencia Carmichael
And the only way that you can be cool
Is if you jump your ass in the pool
Mr. Everlast went up to the hill...
To steal... A style from the brother 
B-Real

And these no-tellin' fools out here gettin' breaks
Who the fuck let 'em make these wack ass tapes?
A homie said ""Squash it"" and ""Just let it slide""
But I gotta shoot 'em down in the middle of the ride
I heard your head was big, but I can still crush it
Every tape you made, you know we had to flush it
Fuck it, pass me the brew and let me swig a..
Uhh.. It's the funky white nigga


The black fool from the other side
Watch me when I hoo-ride
Creepin' up on you from the blind side
Now, here we go, all y'all niggas bring it on
Road dog's barkin' in a d????ne

Nuttin' but bullet holes left in the wall

Memphis girls are sweet

New York girls are hard
Miami girls are soft

Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down

Canadian girls are prim
Russian girls are unpredictable
Japanese girls are slim
Australian girls are unrestrictable
African girls are hot
Alaskan girls are cold

Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down
Give me a world girl

Yeah, now I know these suckas wanna wreck your self-esteem
‘Cause he ain’t wait to wake you up from all of your dreams
But I just wanna see you whip around in Mercedes
And living in a Valley house just like the Bradys
You represent a player, gon’ be flyer than feathers
I never wanna hold you back, want you to be better
And I’m talking Mary, Essence, and Lisa, and Vanessa, and Meesha, and it’s sugar
Cincinnati redbones, Chi-town brown pieces, the keeper
The ones that make you look great
When you’re at the table and other bitches come in to hate
She’s not a creeper, but black pussy won’t wait
It’s pretty much the only thing that ain’t too great
When it’s deeper, so keep your eyes on me
Only put your thighs on me, make the others despise on me
‘Cause I’m selfish to a fault
Don’t want nobody else to see what’s in my vault

So bring me a world girl
One that will make my world go round and round
Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down
One that will make my world go round and round
Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down

I want a world girl

Ah-ha. Really? Do you hear me, bro?
Got my name all on your lips when your chick trips
Oh no, never will I lower to your level

You don't need no Viagra or ExtenZe

They put their cushion on your front
And they swing it from left to right until it ends
But then they all catch feelings and the psycho shows
And that's when they become them passive aggressive hoes
Talkin' bout flippin' it with what she do with her toys
You can't put nothin' in me, bitch! I'm a boy!
And if you keep annoyin' me
I'ma pump yo' pussy full of lead and poison both your ovaries
I'm fly, too fly
I wish it made sense to say Three fly

Sterile from the barrel, so that means that I'm clean

Come get up on it
If you get it, you gon' get it
You know how I get when I hit it, I split it

Niggas in L.A. they talk just like a bitch
Mouth open like ho pussy complete with the drips
You lucky my security don't want it to pop
They looking out for you bastards
If it was me, you'd be shot
Real men don't gossip and real G's don't plot
They put it down where they started
And once it start, it don't stop
If you had as much money as you niggas had words
You'd probably be up on it 'stead of down on the curb
I'm a legend and a playa and a gangsta to boot
The only banger with the key to the city in my loot
I've had a spell placed over me that'll screw up your luck
If you put your mouth up on me, probably you'll be fucked
That's the voodoo that Pirus do, that fly crews do
That fire on tired niggas who block cock like you do
Killa and a prophet, Nostradamus with Glocks
Acquitted at the trial, only my hair is in locks
Now kick rocks

That Nigga's Crazy  (Repeat 4X)

You wanna know me? You wanna know my mind?
I like to make dope beats and hear dope ass lines
I like to drink from this cup and have a dope ass time
I like multiple bottles, empty, but all in a line
I'm a star, you can only be a co-star here
That should be cool considerin' that you wasn't shit last year
Super Cocky Disc Jockey used to fight like Hockey
Apollo Creed on Rocky
I'll make you bleed if you mock me
Checkin' niggas on Twitter who wanna brand me as bitter
Watch your mouth and bite your lip or get it split by a spitter
Now do every drug you wanna 'cause it's all from the earth
Make them lines, do some lines, just remember your worth

Why don't you pull your plug you stupid nigga


If you're steering wheel is not wrapped in wood then you don't have the touch
So you will never feel it cause you denigrate too much
Who are you to judge, who are you to critique, who are you to falsify my presence
I am unique so you can keep your $20 you ain't gotta buy my CD muthafucka not a problem
That's why I'm a recluse, not the one you set loose
Muthafuckas in this game use my name to get juice
Say it, David Blake, a maven, amazing
B-b-brighter than the forest when it's blazing
Asteroid, past the void, keep it pushing, that a boy
Gotta get it hotter than oven cooking, that's a joy
For these last four bars I take it easy
But you still a muthafucka and your cheesy
Don't trust your memory
Write down what you feel about me
If yo head ain't rocking back and and forth then doubt me",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-fire-and-brimstone-lyrics

Killer Dope,The Book of David,2011.0,"How come y'all niggas bitter? Hatin' so much
You wanna be up in my hair, but you can't clean your brush
Shit evaporate, you just exacerbate
What makes my sex life great, you gotta masturbate
Your hair is fallin' out, my hair is growin' in
I put my hair in curls and put yours in a garbage bin
Then play piano on stage, live while I rhyme
And you niggas can't even bounce and rap on time (I think I got it)
I bet Eazy-E is turnin' over in his grave, to see that some of y'all made gangsta rap gay (gay)
I got a brand new HK, and I sniper practice each and every day (okay)
My mama's conversation on the phone, short wit' me
I think she wants to have a heart-to-heart wit' me
I told her I would kill you niggas smartfully
I'm the star player; you can't start for me

Play that Quik shit, and get ‘em all sparked
Everywhere from Aard Park down to Carver Park
I keep it avenue, I’m bringing brothers hope
Liquid change colours, that’s that killer dope
The street never changes, only faces do
Every several years, it replaces you
I get the people loaded, when they can’t cope
Put me on the burner, got that killer dope

I be all precision like the Temptations men, before Paul Williams’ replacement stint
Or rehabilitation with the name is, my drinking situation is the same as his
Attention deficit cause I don’t pay you none
I got the word before you came in, they say you done
Trying to fix your pockets with some broken tools
You run a broken school, full of broken fools
Now go and clean out your desk
Take your name plaque with you while they clean out the rest
I’m the new executive movement I’m beating my chest
And I’m a mess, I digress
That I’m too mature for the job I got, too young for the one I want
Two won when my cards go flop, give all my homeboys a blunt
‘Cause the point is, two spliffs or double jointed
Now let’s all go get high on my enemy’s supply


I gotta be simply one of the greatest, one of the hardest
One of the smartest, one of the brightest
One of the ones who helped start all this
Some niggas eatin' simply because I chose to be an artist
Way back when I was homeless, way back when I was carless
Way back when my sisters used to kick me out their apartments
They back with their hands out, but they made me so heartless
I don’t even put cans out, I ain’t tryin' to donate
I ain’t giving you bitches loans, this ain’t no fuckin' bank
I ain’t no house nigga, like-
If this is UAC music then what makes this so awful
I’m back with the strap in my lap, I’m back in the hood with the gat
I’m back with the drink in my trunk, don’t think so I’ll drink till I’m drunk
I’m back in the kitchen, slow roastin' a lesson
And I play my own piano, don’t call y’all for no sessions
I’m a threat and a blessin', known to keep cowards stressin'
While I’m relaxin' at the shooting range releasin' aggression
Now tell me how you want it


Shouts goes out... to myself
I love me DJ Quik, fuck the world!",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-killer-dope-lyrics

Way back in 1991 owwww I useta know her

Well 1991 I was rockin my jheri curl, just a young gun
Lookin for the bitches that have alot of fun
Just dropped a hit record now I'm under the sun
Winter time night fall cold as hell
Standin outside of the Golden Tail
Hella hoes mobbin in pushin gettin through
Tiger striped cat suit lookin' at me to
I asked her whats your title and she said it was V
Vanessa you impress a nigga can't you see
What you doin' later can I kick it with you?
She said it all depends on what you wanna do
Took me me to her buddy walked in the room
Buzzin off the kamikaze that I consumed
Talk, kiss, grind tryin to get get my balls off first
She said, ""Nigga, can you take my drawers off first""
I was young I admit it
She told me I was horny and wild but still let me hit it
Hot bare back until I felt that quake
She told me shoot that milk shake, shoot that milk shake
God damn I don't wanna get sprung
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy
Ran home to tell my nigga Top
About this cock that just would'nt stop yeah
I told him she was greeneyed light skinned and fly
He said he met a bitch like that last july
A car pulled up and it was her no doubt
I told him thats who I'm talkin bout
He said thats who I'm talkin bout damn
I useta know her

Now here's the plan in the home of the one night stand
Rolled up in a stretch, pussy to catch
Plus now I'm sittin the V.I.P
And hoes wanna suck on the D-I-C
O.K. heres the play give me OJ and tanqueray
Have you had you dick today is what I'm thinkin
But I've been drinkin
I see you peepin me out
And its freakin me out
Cause she fine than a motherfucker bout 5'8
135 and I just can't wait (for what)
To hit the backside, and get the top love
Bucknaked in the hot tub
Cause she knew who I was and what I am and what I is (who are you)
The flyest nigga in the rap biz
And there playin my song so a nigga gotta go and uh
Put a ho in the limo
She was askin me question after question
Until she seen my life size erection
I bent her over prepared to do my duty
And seen my nigga Quik's name on her booty
I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
We useta know her

Way back in 1991 owwww I useta know her

(We're runnin out of beedees) Now who gon do the honors
I hit the liquor next to Benihana's
But on my way I met bitch as sqaure as a box
With a big ass booty and some goldie locks
And I ain't gotta do much talkin' she wet
Because she seen me moving a '97 Corvette
The good thing is I never seen her around
So I took her to my spot to get down
Now AMG what you think about the bitch

She dance in the jet strip
Shakin the cock, 20 dollars a pop
Her nickname Babygirl, useta have a jheri curl
Now she got braids, ex-nigga paid
She useta roll a lexo now she got a pathfinder
Wear a rubber if ya get behind her
Cause my nigga told me she had the heebie geebies
Give her drank and dank she'll give a nigga freebies

Black Friday,UnKnown,2016.0,"I look around and the whole scene is different
It seem like life is different
What's wrong with us, why the police wanna kill us?
Why black people emotional?
Black people know it, you the same color outer space
You should not feel out of place
Curtis Mayfield said it, James Brown said it
Now stop faking pigment, and go embrace your heritage
Ain't no good or bad hair, only fine or course hair
That is so divisive, why do my sisters care?
I been on my own, 30 years strong
I was broke as a bone, nowhere to call my home
But I knew I had talent, I knew that I could do it
That thing that change your life, don't give no credence to it
Make you put your feet into it
Don't let the evils distract you or make you quit
Because if it was easy he could do it
If 'Pac was here, he'd write a song that would calm you down
And I would maybe produce it, give it that Compton sound
He only haunts me now, I see the truth and further
He knew them rap magazines would instigate his murder
I'ma tell you like that, cause' I can tell you like that
Pour out a little liquor, 'Pac communicates through Quiksta
Now I'm drinking Perrier Jouet and apple juice
I've been drinking Perrier Jouet since I was 29
I made the history books when I was 29
And now I heard every line 'cause people always lying
Now me heart is telling me that this is what you need
So before I leave I'ma give it to you , give it to you yeah
Without no pop scream there, let you know I mean it yeah

Solitary mind, military mission
I tried to get my people's to chill, that's my intention
But you can't stop the back and forth when a brother dies
And families gotta pay for funerals without a dime
Deadly force cases, brand new databases
And Trump wants to stop and frisk us, profile him as a racist
Don't put your hands up, don't ask them not to shoot
Just say you wanna live, now that's a common truth
You can't believe the TV, that's only part of the scandal
There ain't no filter on the web and that's too much to handle
Since Eve done bit the apple, we all get hit with shrapnel
Them tear gas canisters just explode and then we get trampled
Now see yourself in my voice, I say what you don't hear
I say what they don't print, because the truth is so feared
And that's just so weird
They make you bury your reality with drugs and a beer
Don't you hear me?
Don't you hear me? (Huh)
Don't you hear me?",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-black-friday-lyrics

Parked more than 18 inches from the curb
While I'm smellin them stanky stenches from the herb
Red-eyed flight, and I'm lookin for my red-eyed homie
Black Tone, cause I said I might
Just have to pass through, and let 'em hear some shit that's pretty fat
From Spade Ty to King Tee, this is where it's at nigga
Makin million dollar deals at a checker table
And my nephews gone be the youngest niggas with a record label
I'm the only nigga that promised to show up
With more talent than any nigga and I didn't wanna blow up
I shine like glitter cause I'm natural
If on the first night I hit, then that's a ho

Ah, MGD is the beer for me (that's right)
MGD is the brew for me (that's right)
I'm the Q-to-the-U-to-the-I-to-the-K, okay?
Each day I play my way, that's the fly way
And I'm older than a motherfucker, but they still ask me
For my ID, when I buy MGD, feel me?
Cause I've got Indian in my family (uh-huh)
And I've got bitches that's finer than Vanity (hmm)
Plus I'm not living above my means (no) buying Rolexes and rings
Flossing cars that I can't afford, lovin these bitches and whores
You know, I never broke myself to see no ho
Never did time, never took no pride in bein cruised
Don't give a fuck about a pink slip, loose lips sink ships
Hundred miles at least, when I sign a new lease
I never, trick off my fanny with these bitches
You got to be clever, gots to keep yo' mind on your riches
And stop doin the things that keep you broke
And keepin niggas names in yo' mouth you shouldn'tve spoke, no doubt I'm dope
In this game 8 years, some of my peers have moved on
I procede to succeed, I stay within my zone
I'm the baddest motherfucker, yet it's me that you despise
Look within yourself and find out why you wear that dumb disguise

No doubt (no doubt) I got somethin for ya mouth
No doubt (no doubt) I got somethin for ya mouth

From the low bottoms, to the skies I got 'em open
On the scrotum they blowin like it's chronic, high hopin
The P never leaves, be conceivin 'em like intercourse
Up in somethin, keep 'em cummin, Playa Hamm be the source
Of the force you now witness - and this is
Just, another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin, P clique swangin down the 'Shaw
Tricks out here, tryin to make hits
Instead of makin it hard hittin, and perpetratin frauds when they spittin
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders you know
What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin P's, players we be the essence
Fo' life, it's the JB and pimpin Carl
With LTD we havin it all, no doubt

Now I'ma tell ya STRAIGHT UP!  One nigga planned on havin hands on
Messin with what I stand on, but trick you fin' ta get ATE UP!

To within an inner trace of the mind, disintergrates her kind like battery acid
You never got no money from a ho, or seen my {?} with some spokes

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in yo' eyes and tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does
Ho what you cain't see me wit it?  Why?  Probably cause
I stay G'd up from the street up, and subject to make yo' trick go get it

Yeah, naw, nu uh, oh wait up
Hold up on you, you got me trippin
I could've sworn that I just had your coochie drippin
What happened to all the shit you popped in the spot?
Tell me, is this the position that you want it or not?
Is it feelin like the way that you imagined it would?
Am I tight, am I hard, is it fly, is it good?
Can I, bounce you off my leg?
Like I'm playin soccer with ya cock makin you beg
You feelin, Valentino Red that's when that's when you switch
And I'm lookin (lookin) for a 2002 bitch
Cus I'm (fly) feathered up like a cock-a-tail baby
But I'm still gangsta, got it glockin still baby
Cus I can't take chances
With ya man friends
Sockin you up in the back, where your hands be?
He ain't goin crazy, he just thinking maybe
Soon as he turn his back, we be going baby

You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You and me, hand in hand
We be getting nasty
You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You are so doooown, down, down...
Now I don't know what I'm gonna do about you baby
Say ya nasty, and ya freaky
You play the freak

Last night we was drunk at the beach
You was off the E, I was off of the peach
Martini, watchin you walk around the room in yo bikini
I touched ya stomach, you got steamy
And then I bit you on the hip
Pulled your brown hair back across my chest and bit ya lip
And then I filled your belly button double whip cream
Then I licked ya clit for a hour fifteen
Who the best, baby? Let 'em know, baby
Valentino on ya titty, let it show baby
AKA mista Q-U-I-K
And I don't care what you do, she do what I say
Cus we share something that nobody here know
Just some up and down sex, not that weird though
In the bed, open window, by the ocean
And the Ecs got her lovin on the slowtion

You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You and me, hand in hand
We be getting nasty
You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You are so doooown, down, down...",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-one-on-1-lyrics

George Foreman microphone, this that German shit
The hoes hit me on it, make me wanna sperm and spit
So they treat me like a permin' kid
I straighten them hoes out
And make them hookers earn this dick
I'm a feng shui nigga
Get me in the club, I'm a rum-straight nigga
It ain't no problem totin' champagne bottles
Now cork 'em all and toast 'em to the player on the grottle
Porsche, I'm in the backseat, too much room for my feet
The benefit to when the DJ's the chef, anytime we go eat
I chop these niggas and cut 'em
Step on they shoe and headbutt 'em
I'm gangsta like no wanksta's like
We don't think alike so nigga fuck 'em
I'm shinin' all through my gold
An archi-pimp and I'm cold
If I like it then I love it
If I look good in it, you need to wrap the bitch cause I'm sold

Check it out, well meet me half way there now
Damn, check this, look
I already know your name is Sheila
Cus I seen you in the front of Players Magazine in the main edition
And it ain't gon' kill you if you give me yo number
What's happenin? Can we hook up later or something? Thank you

I like the way that you don't say much
And when the homies give you phone numbers you don't stay in touch
With that proper little mystic about your ways
About your style that got your boy dazed
Now I'm diggin in my game so I can see where you at
And I'm pushin all the buttons that make you come exact
I know you recognize I'm young and I'm gifted and black
That should be enough to have you sprung and fidgety in ya cat
But yet you play it off swell
To see if I'mma give up on the pursuit of your tail
But even if you knew that ain't all I wanted was just to bone it
I'm still detectin ego trippin baby you own it
But you don't understand I know parts of you that you do not
And I can penetrate right down through your through-through spot
Because I'm talented and young and I got a lot wealth
And I'm the bomb baby, now what you tell me 'bout my self?

Whateva U Do
You make me wanna touch myself
Whenever I'm with you cus you got it (Who go it?)
And I'm gonna make you give it to me (Yeah sing it to me)
Whateva U Do
You make me wanna touch myself
Whenever I'm with you cus you got it (Say what?)
And I'm gonna make you give it to me

C'mon, we can go to my house we don't need the hotel
Now lay down by my fireplace and drink Zinfandel
While I massage your feet, and yo massage my neck
And I won't make a move on you 'long ass you got self-respect
Now check it, I wanna see what you look like in spa
With nothing on yo body but yo panties and bra
Grand Marnier in ya flava down your neck and your back
Aha, didn't know the Quiksta could do it like that
You actin different on the liquor baby girl is that you
The ways your eyes sparkled when I bit yo tattoo
You're rugged but soft baby you're sowed up with fears
And you gotta like pleasure and pain with your navel pierced
But I appreciate you lady cus your makin me wait
Even though that little game you playin is much outta date
I'mma save it for next time and I hope you will too
Cus I like the way you do what you do, baby girl

Whateva I Do
I make you wanna touch yourself
Whenever I'm with you cus I got it (Girl do you know how bad I am?)
You make me wanna give it to you (Now give it to me)

I make you wanna touch yourself
When ever I'm with you cus I got it
You make me wanna give it to you

You know you want it I can see it ya face
That you would rather be somewhere with me takin off your lace
To a bikini shavin pubic
I'm a diamond he's cubic
You gave him yo love and he blew it
Move, let me do it
Because my love is like fire and ice I'm like bitter sweet
Me and my peaches, and you and yo pretty feet
Knowin that if I lick it, tell me then I get closa
While I'm urgin you to drink this Mamosa
Because you know that I got the skills that make you get them crazy leg spasms
By helping you to reach multiple orgasms
Ya hear me? Now feel me, you know what's happenin
So hit me on my hip when you wanna get it
And I'll be over there twenty minutes to hit it
Just as long as you stay cool and you stay true
And just keep on doin Whateva U Do, baby girl!

Quiker-Said-Than-Dunn,Balance & Options,1999.0,"My name is Quik yeah, this is true
Keeping your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore, yo I could never be soft
Asking am I def? And they say the boy goes off
Fill an instrumental with the touch of my rhyme
Suckers stay away because yo, they know the time
Quiet on the set cause I'm about to begin
And if you don't believe me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Quiksta but just call me Q
But It doesn't really matter to you
Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin' I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I cold get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo! I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispaying
And the beat that's playing
Yo! you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Quik's doing it Compton style
That's the city and you say you could get some, yo!
It's Quik-er Said Than Dunn

Woooo!
Woooo!

They made it easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model nor a Dr. Seuss
But I'm not a gangster and I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trauma
With the Q-U-I-K comma, Now that's drama
So pay attention, by the way I must mention
I'm coming off hard in the third dimension
With the glare but you don't need no glasses to stare
Just pop your tape in and it's just like your there
With the Q on the Compton tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip, don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Theo is a dj, not a lawyer dope fly-girl employer
On the (static) that's my station
We get the money and women, while we dipping round the nation
Boy, Mister Quik is toy (suckers)
I'm eating steak while you're sucking with the girls, enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gone still my name if ya don't even know me
Blak Tone (What's up)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at and that's just the sound and next time
I'm peeling your cap to let ya know where I'm coming from
Quik said it and it shall Be Dunn

Woooo!
Woooo!

Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
Quik-er said than dunn yeah that's the title
Loving the ladies, only the fly ones, you know
(But what if she's ugly?) If she comes, she's a ho
Don't ask to battle me home boy, what's that?
You wanna battle me boy, Ya better be strapped
Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playing
 now that's what I'm saying
Said before that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the A-G-E
Girls on my jock, fellas too, it seemed
Had everybody thinking I was only 15
The fellas were ignoring me the ladies were enjoying me
What was I to do? I wish they let the ladies through
Cause the ladies I love 'em nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Quikster Those others be faking
Trying to game fame off the name I'm making
Saying on your records you could get some
Yo homeboy, its Quik-er Said Than Dunn

Woooo!
Woooo!

Rhythm-al-ism (Intro),Rhythm-al-ism,1998.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Pimps, players and women of the night
Welcome to the world of Rhythm-al-ism...
Now since this is my intro
I'mma do somethin' a little crazy
Check it out...
We gon' show off a little bit
Now watch it, 'cause these ain't no studio tricks
I glide smooth over any groove to prove that I can keep on flowin'
Lyrics to the rhythm like a ride, got my tongue tied
Chillin' with the D, KK, AMG, Suga Free, Hi-C, El D' and the P-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E
You'll see a whole 'nother different other side of me
'Cause dissin' don't apply to me
I'll snap my fingers twice and like a bird your bitch'll fly to me
Because she's overwhelmed
You know I kicks the realm when I kick it
My name is Quik and that's the ticket to let me stick it when she trick it
My voice tone hits the trigger
Go deep like a Navy Seal, got her squirmin' like an eel
To kiss her on the cheek is rather bleak
I'd rather run my hand up way up in her skirt and make her squeak, so speak, hold up
If I kick another track to keep you comin' back
Clubs keep pumpin' it, suckas steadily dubbin' it
And I'm gon' keep rubbin' it in your face
Got it tight with the Ism's

California,Trauma,2005.0,"Yeah.. I wanna take this time to dedicate this song to my city
To my county - fuck it the whole state
Let me take a moment to tell you just what it is
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A is the biz
Celebrity down to Cherokee back to the kids
Every level of livin status except for the mid
A paradise situation if that's what you make it
Red and blue equal yellow tape if that's where you take it
Forest fires and earthquakes and manmade lakes
A prescription for chronic tonic to ease your aches
And if you dress right, you can have the best night
Two or three at a time and let the rest fight
The diamonds and red gold might give you a head cold
You freeze like a Jello mold when you hit the light
On Rosecranz you can't make a U-turn
Cross the T flats
 and try to make new birds or shoot back
It's war and peace with no help from police
Either you restin in peace or tryin to conquer the streets
In California
 + (AMG)
Everybody want it but you can't get it
Gangster to the hustler, live to straight win it
It's California mayne (California) it's California mayne (California)
We got movie stars and we got criminals
Boys from the hood and fly saditty hoes
It's California mayne (California) it's California mayne (California)

In Inglewood they come in yellowbone, Compton they come with shots
Carson got the smart ones, 
Watts got the hots
Glass houses in Linnwood, see how they hop
With the ladies gettin ready in hair and nail shops
In Bellflower Lakewood ladies taste good
It stay hood, visitin but stay if they could
With 
KDAY bangin out
, betray us they stood
By the burger stand tellin stories on the wood
With all these dudes and all these bad broads
And all this good food and all these fast cars
Ain't no wonder why Cali got all these glad stars
Forty dollar shots gettin turned up at the bar
It's the Pacific coast {?} how could they doubt you
I did this track out of town thinkin about you
From Eureka through Ventura down to San Diego
California es en fuego, fuego..


Leather and wood, I'm good to the plus
Don't even trip, I did the shoes and the bus
76 and Crenshaw was the locale
I used to smoke out in between my vo-cals
Wherever it's cheap, wherever it's Q
Whatever California want us to do
If you in the red and they get you in blue
Represent your concrete keepin it true
And all my girls in the world, I love you all
I never want you to lose, I won't let you fall
But you gotta get better at lovin a nigga, lovin yourself
Instead of steady comin up on the wealth
I been here a while, I know a pretty smile is a trap
To pull a nigga right up out of his cap
But give me 20 minutes I can widen the gap

Till Jesus Comes,Trauma,2005.0,"I grew up with haters right under the same roof
Ain't never no food, but the whiskey is 80 proof
Niggas is shootin at me, and my sister called the police
To tell 'em that my homies loaned me a piece
Devil-worshippin neighbors, niggas borrowin penicillin
Rats and roaches is chillin, my sister makin a killin
Sellin drugs to my other sisters and now I hope
They break in her fuckin Buick and pinch on her dope
I transferred out of Compton High School with a gun in my pants
Ready for whatever comes and I'm prayin
I ain't gotta be the one shot up in the hospital
Simply because Compton never had one, fuck it
I shot them niggas and I moved to another town
Gave the gun to Darryl and I had him go melt it down
How many times did they call me a fag
'Til they got stomped out and threatened with a 44 mag

We gotta freak the freak the funk
We gotta seize and squeeze the pump
We gotta tease and beat these punks
Get on your knees 'til Jesus comes {*BLAM*}
Give up the keys, get in the trunk
And if he freeze, begin to dump
We gotta smash and kick and stomp, blast a punk
Get on your knees 'til Jesus comes {*BLAM*}

Niggas call me dumb but I'm smarter than your momma
For lettin yo' daddy ejaculate in her and stickin her wit'cho drama
Cause you ain't nuttin but a skanky welfare case
Livin in scum Bum-o-Rama
A shelf full of antibiotics and narcotics
Dwellin in a house full of lazy psychotics
Pissin and shittin on theyself and you too stupid to help
Because you just a dumb nigga yourself
Ain't that the kettle callin the pot round and hot? (Huh?)
Ain't the reason you 'bout to be found bound and shot? (Huh?)
You need to keep my name off your tongue, before they find you hung
With a letter in your own handwriting motherfucker
 w/ ""Get out your"" instead of ""Give up the""

How much liquor could I consume in one sitting?
How many niggas did I shake for bullshittin?
I run any console, I'm an engineer
And I drink imported beer while I'm lookin for the gear
I'm a stylist, I'm not a porn star
I know enough to where I can service my own car
I ain't ignorin you stupid, I just be watchin my own rhythms
And lovin how they fall, this music is different
A new generation
The beat is so fancy, look at my presentation
It's not 16, it's 12, makin a scene as well
Watchin my green and mail, how could I fail?
How could I fail?
 w/ ""drawn down and buck"" instead of ""begin to dump""",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-till-jesus-comes-lyrics

Cause we gon talk about how we was ballin
Before most of y'all niggas crawled in
Bitches callin
Tryin to get the dick of the Quikster
Cause I was rich even before I could buy liquor
Now this is thicker
Although I came to the game with an explicit sticker
It be the little kids acknowledgin that I'm the nigga
I'm sorta like a role model
They love me
I ain't half-assed, pullin full throttle
Now pass the bottle
But hold up for me, pal
Could you make it a corona with Limon Esalle
Limon y sal?
And could you ??(send them in these on so we could show these down)??
So all my little hispanic homies could pound-pound

But it's a whole lot betta
It ain't no jealousy, no snitches, or no feda'
I'm gittin drunk
I'm sayin fuck it with my friends
And I'm spoiled cause my muthafuckin bucket is a Benz
And I'm lookin for my niggga X
With the hydroponic, bubonic, bionic
Chase it with some gin 'n' tonic
Now who got the balls enough to hit that bong
And straight pass out cuz the shit that strong?
But the 1's gotta leave us alone
Cause we ain't' doin wrong

Ay, my musical style is far from intermediate
And my lyrics they flow as if I was collegious (smart)
Take my style you need it
Cus the shit I'm hearing on the radio is so repeated
So repetitive, not to be confused with competitive
Get a bar of this you need a sedative
It'll keep you up all night
Analyze it; dissect it, pretty tough all right
Cus I got some magic goin down
I summon up my powers and get tragic on the sound
Leavin maggots on the ground (wow)
And I'm trying to do it twice and get some rich ass figures
Cus I'm tired of being nice to you bitch ass niggas
And the truth is, I ignore disses
You probably want my missus or you probably want my kisses, little faggot
Never one for metaphors
But now I take competitors, bleeding through that set of doors
Cus I'm pretty jagged

Look at all the things that I go through
Ring the bell, gets the dial tone before I'm even spoken to
What the bloodclot, red Glock, quick to blow ya spot
Why you sweatin when it was dead cold? I keeps it hot, hot!
Figure you could ride me and still play me like polo, that's a no no

Tear it Off,Quik is the Name,1991.0,"Aw yeah, check this out
The Quikster's here, yo Spin let me state this
With the hype and the style that I make this
Groove so hot that you would think that I baked this
This is a steak, I'm a tiger; try and take this
I come off strong with the strength of a dozer
You have no game with your girl 'cause I chose her
I grabbed her hand; I took her backstage with me
We tore it off my friend, now she's yours again
I'm like the Big Bad Wolf on the microphone
So if your girl's Little Red you better take her home
And hide her, before I try to ease on up
To push up on the butt
'Cause a brother like the Quik is chilling with a feeling
For a fly female because I'm able and willing
To tell her the things that make her hot like a cup of tea
After the show she'll be looking for me to tear it off

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (C'mon! Cmon!)

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Word)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Yo, yo Spin)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!(Yo drop it)

Getting busy on dope, could swear up and down then I sold it
Girls on the tip so I hold it
A masterpiece, and a piece I'mma get
From the get-go, I'm gonna go 'til the mic sweat
And heaven knows, anything goes
With those that dispose no Gucci at our hoes
For the AMG, and while you're playing me
I'mma flex the hip hop sex and then I'll be
Nice and smooth and mellow, a hell of a fellow
 example
You can't get with this, I'mma hit with this
Do that dance in my ring while you swing to this
And you thought I was only a pimp, how you figure though
I'll make it good to your girl 'cause a niggaro
Is givin you something with heart and not soft
Yeah, tear it off

Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (Aw Yeah)
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon!
Tear it off! Tear it off! C'mon! (Yo baby)

I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
Money, Quik cuts, The Source with a house to 'ford
And I'll bet the set will be in E-F-F-E-C-T
I'll be arranged to change so I can clock Gs
On stage the world the girls the date, but I ain't fazed
I play the role and I get praise
Freak and the funk and yo, watch a brother hustle right
On the road with rhythm and chorus, mic
'Cause what I'm sayin, ""There ain't no brother like me""
To step into the AM 'cause the AM be the G
And girlies on the tip, but they really on the D
And Quik is on the mix, but if he ain't he on a freak
Take it off baby, 'cause today you're gettin done

Aiyy-yo, aiyy-yo, aiyy-yo, aiyy-yo!


I had to figure out a way to touch 'em
Expose the money and hoes had to rush 'em
Six by nine Pioneers up in my Cutlass
So I can bump N.W.A., and my tape - fuck it!
Gots to work to add to my little paper
Need a boost, so I gots to pull me some capers
Circulate the dollar pull a broad I ain't the type to drape her
She roll and she real - if not, I got to shake her
Or turn her mind to the next page (face)
Face fears fuck, drama let's get paid (paid)
Business first, then we'll crack a spot so we can play
In the cut somewhere with some drink out the way
Now KK is the name, no actin just mackin
Without runnin some game, together we can stack it
Y'all niggas fuckin with the original raspy
Haters talk shit and they split;
Not knowin that they rolled right past me


I ain't nervous - I'm lookin for plot for a debt that's overdue
Hangin out the window of the rental, we dumpin over you
We do walk-bys, skip-bys, bicycle-bys
Waterhose-douse-bys, bush-in-front-ya-house-bys (yes)
Bein a rider is more than sound effects
With wires wrapped 'round ya neck, you know the sound that's next!
{*gagging*} With a twist snap you fall
We duct-tapin your wrists, ankles, laps and all
We love that 'Goodfellas', 'Scarface', all that mafia stuff
But a few volumes of 'Faces of Death' get you coppin it tough
Look at the autopsy, where fly-swatters got mashed for miles
Writin checks that they insides couldn't cash! (ewww)
Like raw steak, them vital organs they soft
Pharoahe Monch and K, like chrome they popped off
Chunky to wicked, and me yeah Quik did it
The murder, the mayhem, like 40 we Sic'Wid'It!


What the fuck do we have here?
Pharoahe Monch, let's make one thing clear
Forget the tiger, I admire the eye of the bull
Spit it for the critics and the undesirables
Quik beats bang like street gangs in inner city
I Bang- like -ladesh, plus bang like shit ain't shitty
Shitty, sell fake Gucci bags on eBay
So advanced when I rhyme that you need time de-lay
These three and up company like Jack Tripper
To get in Depp like Johnny but not Jack the Ripper
Tripped ya, the slumpture slasher

Get Up,Trauma,2005.0,"I'm gettin my kicks dirty, I'm blowin my mid-30's
Niggas they want me buried but, I'm in no hurry
Bullets flyin in flurries, my gat don't work
But I still need one to carry
And I bring the bereavement, when you hit the ce-ment
Police picked me up to talk but I wasn't wordy
I remembered the song that was sang from the birdie
Cause when he whistled he was pushin up that milk thistle, get it?
These stupid niggas they ain't playin for keeps
These niggas playin for cheaps, they disobeyin the streets
Never fear the inevitable, death will come
And when your breath goes numb, you lookin up to the sheets
I seen it comin and I'm watchin the drama grow
And stressin enough to break the needle and thread where mama sewin
I'm slow-flowin, move back and forth like a boa
Still movin hoes in 2's to the boat, like I was Noah

Get up, cause nigga we'll lay you down
You don't wanna be six feet underground
So get up, we don't play around
You gotta watch your back when you outta town
Get up, when you hear the sound
The Compton nigga's comin back for the crown
So get up, when you feel the pound
And your rest is short, we'll lay you down

Black Air Force Ones, guns under the Louis Vuitton bomber
It ain't like I need armor
I give a nigga one warning, cause if I get you shot
Then I'm 2Pac and that's bad karma
I came to get my dip on, find me a round-the-way girl
In Gucci slip-ons, I know what you thinkin
This ain't another diss song, why they bleep me and Quik songs
But Snoop and Nate Dogg get they crip on
The West been gone, I'm from Compton
I know firsthand Quik been holdin it down for 10 strong
And Dre got 20 in, all you got to brag about
Is a couple, bitches and spinnin rims
You wouldn't have a deal if it wasn't no Big

How he get inside MTV with no spins

Pick a car, any car, 24's to D's

Tell her shawty look, all you need is three friends
And get you to the suites, I'ma give you what you need then
Nine inches from behind on you bitches
'Til your pussy need stitches and spines outta commission
Listen tell 'em if they're ready to breeze
Bet whatever they can't eat your pussy better than me
If it's a gamble tell 'em meet me by the Phantom at 3

But was surprised by the size of her thighs and waist
Ay, waste no time tell her come on in
I'm fresh out of Grey Goose and no more Henn'
But shawty got a thong on and fo' mo' friends
See when you live like the man ye ain't gotta pretend
I got her kissin in the mouth on the couch in the den
Then I put it in right up over her chin
Tell her rub in your face, it'll clear up your skin

If lovin the pimpin is wrong Pimpin, I don't wanna be right!
She said her childhood was bad - crying, tellin the pimpin
She got molested by her dad - all she want is attention
Now you want somethin else to feel though? Nigga you mean to tell me
You'd rather settle for apple instead of a peach?
Man a square bitch instead of a real ho? Huh? What, she cool?
Yeah trick as long as you pay for that cuchina you the motherfuckin fool
""Hey Suga Free man, you still the shit!"" Ah yeah playa
That's cause I cracks my whip a lil' bit
And fuck 'em real hard without givin 'em no dick
What the hell fo'? Like you really give a fuck about this dick
And if you did get a lil' bit you'll get lazy and let the pussy sell slow

And didn't fuckin that bitch make you predictable?

If she got any dreams, you want them too
Take her to the county, fill out that CH-7 form

I pop my collar everytime I swallow, wholeness
Rippin the linin up out that motherfucker!
Bitch-ass niggas hatin sayin, ""I don't see how he do it""

Ease up a store run, I'mma throw a ten

Now KK hooked me with a blind date
Got me on the phone mackin to her all night
They say they comin out to meet us on the next day
How come they never look nuttin like what they sound right?
But the bitch got ass like a apple
A derriette with a glass full of gin and snapple
A hairy wet, damn, make a nigga wanna wrastle
When I went to make a play, wouldn't no hassle
Then they tell me AMG is comin out with the rum and the coke
And broads in the Range Rover, they ain't comin broke
Asian and Italian with the fuckin skin tone
That make you wanna bang 'em with the Vodka & Gin Bone

Niggas still party hard, haters still get it
Remember that sweat suit?
You know the gray one with the burgundy trim, nigga I can still fit it
Allen Ives on my feet
Black khakis and my fro lookin so neat
And when I'm chillin with my niggas we so street
You know the kind of muthafuckas that you won't meet
But you got a choice, either you can kick with the hardcore
Or marks in them shear shirts that be chillin in The Source
When the dick is bomb that'll make her call more
Now bang her from the back, nigga make her fall forward

But got a funny intuition about tonight y'all
I think it's down again cus G-one got a grin
And tryin to fill me back up with Chopin
Now I'm runnin from Minnie and Jackie with the blunt
How many more days can I really just party or just bunt
I'm tryin to kick back
But Byze-One keep callin me to let me know how we gotta get out make it crack
Black Tone, Hi-C, Suga Free and me
Listen to the same shit and we all agree
That you gotta party till we platinum
Fuck Osama Bin Laden
Nigga drink up like we back in '93
Compton is the city that I claim, I don't know much
But I know the CPT just can't be touched
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's
Nineteen ninety bad little hoes keep callin me Prince
Where the incense?

Come 2nyte, we'll do the most wanted things

While we comparin bankrolls, you comparin skills

Gotta copy the West to go platinum plus
When I come through the East and hang homey I swang
I leave my radio cause y'all no players out there

Heh, what the hell are y'all hatin for? (Hmm?)
Can't a young player make money any more? (Hmm?)

Two days later, she let me smash
I start rippin’ it out, got to dickin’ it out
I remember her face but couldn’t figure it out
Later on we stroll to my mama crib
Come to find out that bitch was my relative

Now see, that’s the kinda shit that you’re up against
Fuckin’ with them bitches that ain’t got good sense
Now I don’t mean to diss your distant blood, but then
The hooker shoulda known she was your next of kin
Now of them type of bitches, see, I likes to get rid
Because getting set up by a bitch is my biggest fear
So meet me on my couch and I’ll give you the real
That all I got for you, baby, is a dick and a heave

Yeah, you gotta fuck ‘em, feed ‘em, and forget about ‘em
And if my girl ask, I don’t know shit about ‘em
You don’t want me, you just want my wealth
How the fuck you love me and you don’t love yourself?
I don’t know carazy, don’t know karate
But I’ll put a bullet hole inside your Versace
Watch me, I’m not the one to trust
Come and suck up on these nuts like a slut

(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right


Now I’m, puffin’ on a Newport, lookin’ for a new sport
Slam dunkin’ in your pussy, I got the home court
Advantage, you can’t manage to insert the damage
So wrap your pussy in a bandage
Come on, bitch, you better tell me somethin’
Before I pour this Boone’s Farm in your belly button
And uh, I can’t fuck you if your pussy’s stinky
But if it’s clean, uh oh, look out (There’s Mister Winky!)
Making love is like ecstasy

Especially when you serve with the H-I-C
Don’t mess with me, I’ma do you right
When I hit that thigh, it’s like exercise
Now 1 and 2, come on, work it out now
3 and 4, put this in your mouth
Niggas can’t fuck with the style, you don’t hear me
Have your mama and your daddy screaming, “Oh, really!”

Now pussy ain’t nothin’ but meat on a bone
You fuck it and you suck and you leave it alone
Now tell me how many bitches think that you can fade me
When my dick is getting sampled more than a breakbeat
I’m a horny type of fellow; I’ll fuck you, brown or yellow
Move your cellulite ass, make it shake like Jell-O
‘Cause some of you bitches need to exercise
With the stretchmark train tracks running down your thighs

Falling back on that ass with no hesitation
Shit feels good like ejaculation
Bet they can’t wait for the penetration
But if she talk shit, I get to masturbatin’
I give it to ya high, I give it to ya low
Some niggas fuck fast while (I go slow)
Hi-C and DJ Quik, ya playa hatin’ muthafuckas can’t fuck with this

(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right

I had two bomb bitches jumpin’ in my bed
One fell down and start giving me head
I called my nigga and the homie said
“Don’t fuck with them bitches, you’ll end up dead”
When it comes to sex I keep it clean
When it comes to pussy, I’m a fiend
Ain’t giving up shit but ding-a-ling
And if the bitch get hungry, hit Burger King

I heard you sip dick like a coffee cup
So dribble on my gobble and make it stand up
But in 19-90…if you’s a stranger
Lick up on this rubber ‘cause I don’t like danger
And when I fuck you in my back seat
I’m running laps around your pussy like a track meet
‘Cause I’m the DJ Q-U-I-K and I wanna bone ya
Crawf, ask this bitch (Do you wanna…?)

(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“I’m gonna do it”) Hi-C’s in the house
(So right, so right, so right, so right)
(So right, so right, so right, so right)
(So right, so right, so right, so right)

My nigga Playa Hamm, what's up, dawg?
The whole muthafuckin' original, Penthouse Players Clique
Haha, my nigga Eazy-muthafuckin'-E, yeah
And a special thanks, to my nigga, the fonkiest muthafucka whoever tuned a bass guitar, a lead guitar, a piano, and the freak-boards, my nigga Rob muthafuckin' Bacon, yeah
And to all you wannabe producers, he ain't for hire, fools
So you better go hire Stan ""The Guitar"" Man, or some goddamn body
'Cause he ain't for that shit
To my niggas, Sexy Leroy and the Lovelitez
My nigga Top Dawg and my homegirl Shello
With the vocal that's mellow
'Cause we can do that, ha
Now right about now I wanna change it up a little bit
I would like to thank all of these no singin'-ass R&B musicians
Who think that rappers have no true musicianship
This is one for y'all
And may yo' wack-ass albums continue not to sell
And to that nigga Tim Dog, thanks for acknowledging that I'm the fonkiest muthafucka in this business
And also, boy yo' mama can suck a golf ball through a water hose, that bitch is good
And plus I wanna thank my muthafuckin' family
And all the rappers from Compton, except one
A no-rappin' monkey-faced one-hit havin'-ass simple-minded punk muthafuckin'-ass nigga from CMW

Jet Set,Trauma,2005.0,"(feat. Tai Elton Phillips)


A soft beat got me hard as the street
Pop yo' ass in the teeth, leave your head in the seat
I moved scum with my sister 'til they snitched on me
Now we run in different directions from the C.P.V
Money don't come back, problems stay forever
Bullets for my nephews, let 'em perish together
For them I wrote these fuckin lyrics on the back of a summons
Wishin I had a big brother like The Game got hundreds
So I'm flyin my hair out, tryin to air out
Goin callous into my shell I'm kickin my care out
Nevermind my whereabouts, it won't be where family
Like to gank each other and only gangbang in the house
Just a post-traumatic sufferin Hennessy addict
Bufferin won't even help with the static in my muffin so come and cuff him
I'm slippin into the darkside under the influence of my own existance
Like Playa Hamm when he started this ride
Or Shabby and Bull Dog in the Marina
We mack-a-nina sippin colada piñas, you shoulda seen us
When Eric Wright tried to buy me out of bondage from Profile
Cause Ruthless had all the style and now
When did it change, I didn't see it runnin
The curb came, I went over tumblin
My last few records you heard me sick at the heart, gettin picked apart
By the very people makin me breathe, now I just leave

You wanna jet set with me, ain't nothin really here to see
We gon' be steppin off the plane, stress off your brain
See the world as clear as can be
People need class, you go back to school, I tell you what you need to do
You need to be straight relaxin, ain't no reaction
To the thangs that's botherin you - c'mon let's go

My life in a day, I live for the moment
Bein full of focus is my only bonus
I walk around the city with a skeptical pair of pessimistic preconception
And niggas grippin my gonads
And that's only because I know some dudes that'll sabotage your food
Cause they'd rather see you breathin than to see you leavin
Passin the buck, they know you wouldn't be mad as fuck
Better to see you fail than to be drivin the baddest truck
Hard luck bitches who live right next to the liquor sto'
The hazel-eyed beadie smokin bitch eager to lick 'em low
The yeast-infectin misdirectin lowridin lover baby mother
With a mouth like a sailor ready to blow
I work around the clock to keep avoidin the ever-present traps
Of niggas and tramps who see me as the on ramp
Who come from mothers who had a fetish for cocaine in the 1980's
And thought she raised her crack baby to be a lady - you crazy!",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-jet-set-lyrics
Oh Well,Under Tha Influence,2002.0,"It's all I fucking here
""Stay positive, stay humble, stay the way you are""

T'Fuck am I thinkin about?
Shit...
Yeah, just call me the evil stepson of the West Coast
And I'm on one
Mausberg, Suga Free, Black Tone
Now if I broke my leg, tell me would I get carried? (Huh?)
And would you still buy my records if I got married? (Would you?)
Or would I make the shots even if I was hurried? (Can I?)
And will I still be remembered even after I'm buried? (Would I?)
They got me waking up in the mornin and getting loaded
Got me worrying so hard sometimes I'm feeling like my brain bloated
But I'm a break it down, fix it and re-roll it (Break that down)
And let these haters know WE control it
I'm in this for something so different that you couldn't imagine
The style, the flyness and the beautiful hoes (Uh-huh)
The pile, the highness and the pitiful lows (Okay)
That keeps a muthafucka like me up on his toes
No not quite; I want my props on the merit of the hands
That I used to make these beats that bounce around ya Van
I'm just a little grain of sand under my Dog
The one who keeps me humble, keeps me up and working hard, hear me y'all
It's alright to be in love with yourself
But when she locked up on the pussy, nigga put her on the shelf (Lose her)
Shake that cocaine clean yo system on up (Yeah)
Shed that bullshit and come bounce like us (C'mon)
We trying to have fun from Japan to Comp-tan
Spendin twenty grand, smokin Bud-dhan and nigga you can
But I never went back to something that burned out
And I ain't never did a party I didn't turn out, nigga
Yeah, I'm back and G'd up

Things that a ghetto-nigga used to do
(I'm still doin, and I keep it G'd up)
Places that a ghetto-nigga used to go
(I'm still goin, but I got it G'd up)
Thangs that ghetto-nigga used to see
(I'm still seeing it, but I keeps it G'd up)
Get yo shit right nigga!
I got ten on it

Yeah inflation's a bitch
Just like these people tryin to get me to switch
I ain't no damn role model, I can't stop cursin bitch I'm grown
I can say what the fuck I want, get on
I'm a rebel, I gotta keep my shit on this level
Until the day you pat my dirt with a shovel, Hello
Because I'm real wit it, and y'all gotta deal wit it
Put some money back in these ghettos and will quit it
But till then you gotta make me understand
Why it's so hard on a hustling class man
Higher y'alls taxes all my life
Why the fuck I gotta pay y'all just as much as a wife
That's some bullshit, look the tool shed, grab some cool shit
Go on in Will's shed with your homies
Don't be pouting, keep a cool head (Wait)
How many different directions can you pull me in?
And how many courts of the law can you sue me in?
For sayin ""Fuck y'all!""
I'm back and G'd up

Things that a ghetto-nigga used to do
(I'm still doin, but I keeps it G'd up)
Places that a ghetto-nigga used to go

Thangs that ghetto-nigga used to see
(I still see it, but still it's G'd up)
You need to: Get yo shit right nigga!

Now I'm just tryin to do my best whether it's work, play or either
And I ain't trying to be no preacher cus they ain't perfect neither
Some of the coldest entertainers that y'all done seen yet
With the skill to rock these niggas and keep these hoes wet
But there's a method to the madness that we suffer from
Making the hardest dudes tremble and even tougher run
It's called the spirit and it's fly, and it's making me bigger
Keeping me from stressing out and puttin hands on niggas
Ain't religion for me unless it's all to the plus
Whether in the front of the five-hundred to the back of the bus
I'm tryin to keep these little YGs out the line of the fire
Even if it means I'm a take the hit, leak and expire
Now I see what Top was saying before he left his hole
Devil's shine like glitter, my nigga, but keep your soul
Don't give another nigga control of your gold
Share your parties with the world and watch you get swoll, nigga
Yeah, but keep it G'd up

Things that a ghetto-nigga used to do
(I'm still doin, but it gotta be G'd up)
Places that a ghetto-nigga used to go
(I'm still goin, but now I'm G'd up)
Thangs that ghetto-nigga used to see
(I still seein it, but it a gotta be G'd up)
Ya need to: Get yo shit right, nigga!
And you ain't gotta gang bang nigga, just keep G'd up

Things that a ghetto-nigga used to do
(I'm still doin, only if it's G'd up)
Places that a ghetto-nigga used to go
(I'm still goin, but it gotta be G'd up)
Thangs that ghetto-nigga used to see

It costs four bones when you buy it at the place
It's 1700 in the V.I.P
And three bad bitches wanna drink it with me
Now we just tryna kick it 'til they kickin us out
Then I'ma show lil' mamas what this dick is about
'Cause it's a damn movie in the back of my limo
They didn't want it all the way so they just gave me a demo
Rubbin feels good when you're drunk and you're buzzin
Forgot who you was and tried to smash your cousin (I'm sorry!)
So shake that ass like a tree in the wind
Then she gon' migrate with me and two of her friends
They let all four of us in, the after hours is poppin
We buzzin like bees but it ain't no pollen

And hookers get kicked out if it ain't no swall'n

Pants saggin in the city where they known to keep a ratchet
Momma told me tuck my chain, a nigga might snatch it
I was never affiliated, was in it for the thrill
An amigo ever spot it, we stomp and pop a pill
And I, guess that explain why these niggas real
Mouths closed, pistols tucked, everybody know the drill
Doves cry when thugs die, but dude, we kept it real
Did the time, pump the steel, read a book, gainin' skills
Learn you can live by the gun but die by it
But the worst thing your best friend behind the trigger tryna pull it
I went through it all, been there and done it
On the Front Ave., see me lil' nigga you can run it

Have respect and have tolerance, but never let 'em run you

Bitches on my left, and money on my right
Money all in front of me and money on my mind
See, I'm just tryna live, I kill 'em, that's in mic
See I'm about to gas, you can catch me on my bike

It’s Like Everyday,LIFE - Music Inspired By the Motion Picture ,1999.0,"Quik talking:
Yeah, ain't nothin' changed, y'all niggas still obvious
Yeah, it's for real though hmph
Rapping:
Now we don't wanna talk about all the people I'm supportin'
That's more important to a nigga than them diamonds you sportin'
Ain't a sell-out or a bail-out although life is a bitch
And I'm beginning to think that they don't wanna see Quik rich
Cause I'm gon' gather up my homiez & put something in they bellies
Ride around the town bumpin' that CD from R.Kelly
Gettin' at them ghetto queens if you know what I mean
Cause it ain't nothin' like some lovin' dipped in afro sheen
Break it down with two gates in that burgundy eight
Cause real riders don't three wheel they just drown on the skate
Send a care package to my homiez up in Natches
And shoot a kite 'bout how these suckas keep my Benz up in scratches
It ain't no puzzle that's to be expected
Sometimes I think they only come around it just to see if I wrecked it
I feel like hittin' the 101 leavin' town on a bike
On my way up to the Bay to clear my mind cause it's like...

Everyday is a scuffle
Turnin' them corners to get my hustle
Every single dollar is a struggle
That's how it is comin' up in the ghetto

Now I don' been through it all pushin' work on the boulevard
Runnin' from the 5-0 in somebody else car
Ghetto dreams so it seems to be easy
Think about my life & I get queasy
Pumpin' the pimp knowin' it ain't helpin' me
But the ghetto got me trapped thinkin' this is how it's s'posed to be
A cold thang when you knowin' yo' gang ain't got yo' back
But you still put yo' life on the line for no snaps
R.Kelly:
This ghetto world is one big battlefield
That's why we get rich and move to them hills
Everywhere we go the haters tag along
But don't let that stop you get yo' hustle on
Maus-Berg:
But dog you gotta do yo' thang get yo' grind on
Eliminate the fake & keep yo' game strong
Don't let the streets be yo' downfall
Keep it real with yo'self & you gon' rise 'til you ball dog
Chorus
Quik:
It's gettin' down to ground level but tryin' to keep time
Cause my hustle & my tustle is my beats & my rhymes
And I'm lovin' this collabo' cause Rock Land is saucy
And Quik is trying to get Versace staying flossy wit Mausy
But the...
Maus-Berg:
...drama don't stop but you can make it better
Don't point your finger at the next man get yo' cheddar
Lifestyles of a thug ebonic definition dog nothin' but love
But we gon' ride to 'til we can't ride no mo'
Pop a bottle a pair of D's and let the wind blow
When you get it appreciate it cause those who ain't got it gon' hate
Every dime is a struggle so I'mma suffer everyday
Quik:
Now my conscience got me wonderin' do I be in the flow

I knew that I would get some resistance whenever I took this stand
Now this is how yo' street works, everybody hates each other
Until they in each other's face, and then it be cousins brothers
And loved ones, it's all just a race
To see who can grab the most nuts and get back to the house in one place
You niggas wanna be on squirrel time, I'm around the world time
Until I gotta come back to court, talk to my kids and they're fine
This is my intro, I'm scratchin' Chingy, comin' blingy this time
I'm showin' off my hands and freestylin, showin' you through my mind
This is for Roger Troutman, he helped me when I was so blind
To see that y'all would freak out on me at an opportune time
I shoulda seen it comin'

Niggas tryin to talk me outta this shit
I'm tryin to put this nigga outta this bitch
He fuckin with my chips I gotta resist
I'm tryin to put this nigga outta this bitch
Niggas tryin to talk me outta this shit
I'm tryin to get this hooker outta this bitch
She fuckin with my chips I gotta resist
I'm tryin to get this hooker outta this bitch

I live in Los Scandalous, California
It's the most beautiful sunset 'til cowards run up on ya
And then it's curtains you hurtin' for what yo' mouth had been blurtin'
Where you don't love who you squirtin cause she just might be workin'
I ain't sharin a fuckin' thing, I'm a rider for certain
Shake the homies with self-esteem problems, give 'em some Jergens
Bitch problems weaken the love for the homey seekin' to sub for the homies
Tweak and do drugs now no homey he just be lurkin'
My best friend's dead, my heart is a stone
My soul ain't even mine to own, they say it's a loan
And I feel sorry for any nigga that diss me it's on
I'm comin' with pencils pistols and crystals you gone
It's premeditated now nigga


Man I done seen the nigga go through some shit
Family messin' with him, gangbangin', man
Get his drink on, for a long time
Trippin', gettin' on motorcycles man, and standin' on 'em
Losin' and fallin', scandalous-ass baby momma
Lettin' homies, so-called homies fuck
Tryin' to make my nigga look bad
Then they end up in Atlanta, got hit with some hot ones

Cause I'm flyer than crochet, cool as a blizzard, I delivered (uh-huh)

Thank my niggas in the street, thank the soldiers lose they life for this freedom we all love
Only thing we know is life, It's alright (yeah)

I rhyme without writing, no height (yeah)
I'm saying fuck you like Huggabug
Don't forget to mention my name when you mention the city, little shitty (you need me)
I got my hood on lock, whipping out my passport, I traverse the globe nonstop

Now can you sell it?
Do you got the concept that the people can't live without hearing? Did you hit the tar-get?
Can you sell it?
Do you got the dollars with the sense of an entrepreneur bringing the dope raw and pure?
Huh, can you sell it?
 x3
I don't think you can sell it
Huh, huh, now can you sell it?

Can you sell it?
It's aroma, can you smell it?
Inhale it

Looking developed, sitting relish (angelic)
Put it on paper like a scripture, exilir, mixture, fix the present fixture, is this the

Fire future music mixture (a stickler)
Gotta be right, are you playing? (what you saying?)

Me and Daz on that ave all cash in our pockets about to rock us with bellies (can you sell it?)

The idea of going to America, especially the West Coast!

Streets Iz Callin’,The Best of DJ Quik: Da Finale,2002.0,"I see I gotta play another game, so…
If I’mma go out, I’mma go out right, you know’m sayin’?
(Talk to ‘em, dog) Cool wit’ it all

I’m untouchable (yeah)
I’m on a plane, Calcutta bound
Meeting with them people from that sample we done turned around
Trying to stop the war with a hardcore dancefloor type of lesson
‘Cause the truth will hurt forever more
Now what’s my punishment? (What?)
You mean to tell me I could get sued for making sure my people have some fun and shit? (Damn)
It’s a funny game
It’s like the time that ol’ boy got Pac, and me, and Jackie kicked off that Houston plane
For drinking Remy Martin, acting up and starting
And that’s all I got to say about that—pardon
‘Cause that’s a binge frenefit, nigga been the shit
I fucked around and did business with niggas on some friend shit
But to no avail, this is show and tell
Only thing I ever got for working was a broken nail
That’s all I really know about the streets
It’s the hustle, get hustled, get down or get beat

Wake up in some herbs this morning
And I can hear the streets, they’re calling
Wake up in the pool this morning
I can feel the vibes, they’re calling

Now I done helped a lot of enemies that didn’t deserve it
That’s probably why I be the one that you won’t see at their service
We swerve and never nervous (Never) I’m a daredevil
Just ask the homie Pervis, nigga, we on their level
Ain’t nothin’ gon’ stop the flowing, and the 4-4’ing, and showing
That I done been a corporation when y’all was still growing
Niggas say I fell off, ha, (Fell off?) They gotta say that
That give ‘em false security to think they demo ain’t wack
Nigga, I’m standing on a bottle looking over the fence
Trippin’ off this bullshit that we up against
Crippin’ is mainstream, pimpin’ is ballfield
The truth is stranger than a lie but it’s all real
I’m a mack from the P-card, a G, a star
A rider, a rebel, independent, believe we are
Trying to forget about my past, that’s all
Open a bottle of Cristal and pass it to y’all
Now what up? Where the riders at?

Wake up in some herbs this morning
And I can hear the streets, they’re calling
Wake up in the pool this morning
I can feel the vibes, they’re calling

Stomp out my house on the hill, to El Villa Negril
The Mediterranean, pay me and I’m back at the wheel
In Montego Bay, drinking with G, Dr. B
Chuckey mack a fe’, watch her climbing up the coconut tree
Suga Free is no sweeter than the bitterest fruits
Blame it on Compton and my niggerish roots
I’m down to kick a hater with the biggest of boots
It’s not about the strap, it’s ‘bout the nigga issues, fool
I’m SuperCalifornialisticexpeal-a
Creep around the city in a red Impala
Short-tempered nyggas get stuck and die wet
And short-money nyggas speak a different dialect
So give me my Cris’, give me my hits, give me my bitch
Give me my spliff, give me my fifth, give me my gift
Tropical skin color, nice and thin mother
Of my virtual kids because I hump in thin rubbers
Now…

Wake up in some herbs this morning
I can hear the streets, they’re calling
Wake up in the pool this morning
I can feel the vibes, they’re calling",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-streets-iz-callin-lyrics
No Bullshit,Way 2 Fonky,1992.0,"All the way from the hood
One chocolate nigga up to no good
Yo I gotta watch my back, cause it's like that
Too many fools on a mission
Tryin to put in work for a hood they ain't even got they ass in
Everybody got beef, with me and my crew
But ain't nobody step yet (so what the fuck they do?)
Talkin all day shit
Runnin they motherfuckin lip worried about who a blood or crip
Man, fuck the red and the blue team
Fool, my color runs green
And it'll stay as I choose
And if my homies ain't down, they catchin the blues
They wanna stab me in my back huh?
But soon as they do, I'm comin back at cha
The same go for a bitch
She wanna fuck and be good, til the money maker switch
And then I'm out on my limbs
Be got a grip on myself, and kicked the bitch to the wind
Cause my trust goes to no one (yup)
And sometimes - I can't trust my damn self!
It's a god damn shame
Ain't no reason to blame, one fool or one game
But it's life and a nigga gotta deal with it
Man, I'm just tired of the bullshit

Now if the gangsta shit is what you're cravin for
And the funky ass tape is what you're savin for
Then look no further, cause I'm the brother
And I'ma break it down and kick the shit once more
Now the niggas tryin to disrespect the Q they get knocked out
Niggas tryin to disrespect the crew they get drug out
Niggas tryin to catch a nigga slippin get snuffed out
And bitches tryin to set a nigga up they get carried out
And yeah that bucket that you ridin in, when the Glock roar
That's the same motherfucker you'll be hidin' in
Fifteen holes, flat tires and your windows gone
Now what's really goin' on?
From Denver to Phoenix and even St. Louis
Everywhere we went, fools tried to do us
And to the suckers thinkin' that a nigga wouldn't steal
How your jaw feel, and is your nose healed?
Somewhere along the line they musta heard the rumor
Of my underground days mixed with bangin' and humor
And when I got on stage, they all jumped in my way
Shoutin, ""Whattup cuz?"" just to see what I'd say
But I ain't trippin, just checkin a grip
I ain't crippin' or even ruinin' blood'n, just smokin a bud'n
Gettin' bent, so if you wanna see me throw a full fit
Then come up in my face with that bullshit",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-no-bullshit-lyrics
Ladies & Thugs,Trauma,2005.0," Let's go Quik

I wanna, punch them niggas sayin gold don't rock
And I wanna, rape that bitch that told a lie on 'Pac
I wanna right some wrongs before I put my coast on lock
So when you see the Glock bastard don't you go into shock
If the hood hates me I'll buy your enemies guns
And have 'em clappin on you shermheads, takin your funds
Scarin you motherfuckers to death, give you the runs
You better nice up, before you leak and warm the ice up

I wanna murder the sniper that shot at Martin Luther King
Then get rid of the Viagra cause I'm strictly ginseng
Campaign in the hood if you want progress
Take all the gangs, put 'em up in Congress
Quik is so quick, listen to the ba-bum ba-bum
Brooklyn Zoo, California, with guns the size of
Elephant trunk, trunk trunks, ladies shake your hump hump
Get your ""Flashlight"" cause we crunk like P-Funk

Ladies - I know you feel me
If you up in the party let me see you shake your body
Like you got no bones and you tipsy off the Henny
Thugs - easy with the slugs tonight
I'm tryin to meet my wife tonight, make love tonight
You don't wanna see yo' body on ice, right

Now if I snapped, it was just a matter of time
Before I turned into the Mad Hatter, splatter your bladder
On the morning after, you can't refute the disaster
Cause body parts get musty in plaster (ew)
Don't try to call a truce cause I'm still comin after you
I don't like your kids but I'mma spare 'em; maybe later
Add 'em to my harem, and share 'em with the niggas you like the least
That still got it out for yo' ass when you swiped the piece

Yo, ever since ""The Score"" Quik these rappers just bored
So I ain't rap no more; I wrote songs for
Whitney Houston you could catch me with Santana
Bandana on tour, DipSet'n like Santana
We don't sell like we used to sell?
That's cause they live in America, we get worldwide sales
I'm on tour half of the year, you can't see me cuz
And your career gon' be as long as Britney's wedding was, ya heard?


California, knows how to party
When I land in the L-A-X
Quik picked me up, four freaks in a stretch
Big California chronic, me nah smoke sess
But it's all buddha bless from the East and the West
Throw up yo' set, I don't say this often
But we gotta keep the peace, too many in a coffin
Pour some liquor for my cousins out in Compton

I'm not a kingpin, I'm just a wing man
Strapped to the teeth with a blunt, and a green can
A-B-C-D-E-F no G
Hennessy and Olde E, we run so deep
86 your concubine, he's just an old creep
You're so weak nigga and your hoes is so cheap nigga
You can't even get a prop on your own street

A cash spender, ass bender, I'm ass in
Let's get it crackin like a brothel in here; a whore house
Got these bitches walkin nekkid throughout the whole house
What the fuck you think my life is about? Bitches hatin
What you think that butter knife is about? Bitches hatin
To see what this nigga's dick is about
Do he be just talking shit? No I doubt
He got years of clout
Like a rebound on a credit line on a Master Card
Swiped it right between her pussy, then I bashed the bone
Then I juke it for a minute as I punched in my code
Then I waited for the pearls to come out, low and behold
Bankrupt cus ya stank stunk, frontin like a pooh bear
I opened up ya cock and hollered then, ""Who there?""
""Nobody just us lice"" That's nice
Little buggers, done grew up to be the size the rice
So I jumped back shocked and grabbed for my colla
Her pussy depreciated to pennies on a dolla
Now what the fuck? If you want the dick get the fuck up
And stop actin like a old tampon; stuck up
Give me something to put my stamp on the tramp gone, ""What up?""
I make ya bust nuts till ya nut up

Then fuck up in the room with the door locked
Wake up Divorced looking for some more cock

Shabity wee-rock sweet cock, juicy boo
Like Crips and Piru, shit, we gone do
I fell into the club and hit the dance flo
Ya boy got mad cus what I dipped with his ho
Baby girl had my tinsel returnin slow
She was sick, got me looking for Pepto-Bismol
Shit stackin, jaw smackin, dolla dropa
Dice shakin money makin holla hoppa
Home wreckin, ho checkin dick is slow
Bring me back Cognac, from the liquor sto'
Bet you didn't know that ya ho is a freak
Every week she got something up in her jaw meat
And it ain't policies, spit it out
You gone tear my zipper on me before we, get it out
They wanna be touched by the untouchable click
Don't hate participate, yo sing that shit

When I'm wit a ho, take her to hustle
More money ya muscle
Shake a hooker like a trick up
Leather and Wood 304 to the good
When I'm pimpin I'm jaggy
When I'm pimpin I'm saggy
When I'm high I'm a fly guy into the cat
?? the day Federan the man
When I put it on floss mode looking for ants
You a straight gone bad, ho wishin ya had
Now get up in the pad, dick suckin I'm glad
Never knew what a ho was, checkin ya buzz
When I'm sittin in first class
Take it in the ass
Nigga you done lost ya playa pass
Trick nigga, 304 niggas been ran up in that ass
Smashed up on the gas of the S-5 double
Like I said when I bouble its trouble

I mean you niggas claim to be riders and thugged out
And super OG and all that old shit
But for real, what would you really rather be doin?
Would you rather be in these streets scrappin and shootin with these niggas
Or somewhere with a blunt in your mouth
Getting ya dick sucked by a bad ass bitch? (Yeah that's me) Hm?
Now Super Socka with Gin and Seagrams and sweet and sour
Sippin, suckin on my sausage gave the stripper some power
Limpin everytime she get lead, you come poppin that shit
Then wimper like a little puppy when your walls get hit
Suckin ya thumb I make ya cum, one by one
Till we both get up the mountain and just pop like guns
Composure, if I keep it past the two-minute mark
I'ma bang till the sun peaks so you in the dark
Cus I'll lick you for 15, make you steamy and cream
Then lick you for 30 more cus I'm a nympho's dream
What the dealy? We stay like peanut butter and jelly
Pull apart when you get silly then just eat on ya belly
Don't go tell him, it was me that had you all in the Cut
Cock in ya twat, tongue in ya ear, thumb in ya butt
Making you nut, my nuts they endorse your chin
I graduated from ya cock and took the course again

Well I met this bitch, she hard like a man
5'6, ass thick with a crispy cream tan
Jawbone like no other and quick to get another
Hooker just like her to come stroke y'all bird
She be hummin on your balls, never wear no drawers
Lift her skirt up out in public, pager overflowed with calls
Ditchin outta school to come and kick it with y'all
Givin you braggin rights for the homies when she hand you a bra
But she married now, got a husband and kids
Tryin to settle down, shake all them niggas she did but bitch
Age'll never take the freak out of a freak
You gon still want a different dick 3 Fridays outta week
One day I bumped into her at the car wash
With her kids, titties fell, and her ass was all squashed
Sayin ""I go to church and I live with my spouse""
""But follow me and let me drop my kids off at pumpkin's house""
""So we can...""

I took ya from Boone's to Don Pi, free-styles to MTV
Demo tapes to my new CD
I'm still the God to your Vertical Joyride
And will, coat your whole hide with fluoride
When I smack that ass don't forget ya chips
When I slide between ya titties better wet ya lips
I'm the imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight even though they are dikes
When she grabbed the mic, it felt like she had two tongues
KY'ed the (?) and then stroked the two buns
It was fun and all
But one of my balls was stuck up in the sugar walls
Y'all had to pull and push
Man the fuckin push was pull
Mixed with Belvedere and Red Bull
Shit I took (?) pimp and thought what the fuck?
And tried to stick my other nut up in her butt so she can...

I'm a stone funkaholic yet I don't need Schick
Because there ain't another nigga more versatile
DJ Quik been bustin' funky rhythms all the while
And this song is for the homies who was down with me
When I was broke as a joke, flat with no mon-ey
And to them doubtin-ass motherfuckers, 'cause they don't know, yeah
Instead of showing and proving, yo, I'm proving that I'm the show
Now who wants to fade this modern day prophet?
Take two steps forward, one shell and you're dropping
Because I don't go toe to toe, I go ho to ho
Yo' ho is so-so, so yo, I think I better let her go
'Cause she ain't worth my time
And before I get off into another rhyme
I'mma bring this verse to a climax, grab the axe

That means I'm true to my game and my cap
And I refrain from being played like a sap
And a bitch?  No bitch can handle what I'm kickin'
They say I'm trippin but they stick around my room for a dickin
'Cause the power of the Quiksta's too overwhelming
And when you let me rip, I'm going in with a helmet

When You’re a Gee,Way 2 Fonky,1992.0,"When you a G, niggas wanna be like you
Because a G has images what they look up to
But some don't make it, so they takin the funk
They get hot and they be poppin that gangsta junk
But that ain't G, that ain't even close, nah that ain't shit
It ain't about who can bang or slang the most 'caine
And ki's or O's, sport new clothes
Or about who can fuck the most hoes
Cause it's a mind-state, it's playin it's manipulatin
It's winnin from the freakin and manuervin and then captivatin
Livin the life that make the bitches wanna fiend and dream
And all the jealous niggas mean and scheme
And weak minor suckaz they wanna show they ass
But a nigga like Quik'll check em real fast
They don't know the real and so they quick to assume
That's why they shut up when I enter the room
Cause I'm a G
""Playin tough..
But them niggas ain't really rough..
CREAMPUFFS is a better word than tough!""

When you a G, attention is yours when you demonstrate power
And game the untrues imitate
They get frustrated, they sock girls and slam doors
But when you're a G you just check yours
Takin up the slack, all the way around
And then my back got yours, then we ain't goin down
Like Playa Hamm said, it's the thing that I pray for
And play for, that I slay for
Cause I'm the G when it comes to a funky track
I'm the G when it comes to the whole sack
I'm the G when it comes to decision makin
I'm the G that got all these niggas blinkin
I'm the G that's young and intimidatin
I'm the G never sprung got the bitches waitin
I'm the G suckaz fear because I'm strong
And I'm the G, never standin alone
Fadin em - left to right, front back to center
I'm a natural born winner
I got connects on a quest to be true
So I won't teach you what I know;
I'mma teach you what YOU KNOW - yo
My game is tight so if you're lookin and listenin and learnin
Apply it to yours and you'll earn respect in abundance
And you can never be checked see
When you're a motherfuckin G
""Y'all better get hip..
And come off this trip..
Wit'cho ?? killin asses""

The G-ness, when you a G it's the description
The suckaz are fearin it, cause in the mack they keep on hearin it
They wish they could neglect it
But they can't so they disrespect it
And when they run up, yeah they get chin-checked
When you a G, backs to backs never duckin
Suckaz freakin yo' bitches though, dismissin the hoes
Before a bigga nigga, when you a G you're the teacher
Any other way that I coulda come just might not reach ya
The G-ness, such as my gangsta mentality
The G-ness, such is the greatness of my pals and me
Destiny's testin, trueness of character
Since I'm a G, fuck with my brothers that fucks with me
Come to the Penthouse if you want if you aren't true
And journey through the mind of a G since he ain't you
It ain't just the mack or the sack or the strong back
It ain't just the plain simple fact we got all that
It ain't just the dead weight, that we droppin daily
Crews I don't forget, cause my memory don't fail me
Those that know know I know that they do
Those who are wondering? (Motherfuck you)
I only owe to P.P.C. - a chosen few
I got Players all around me, doin what they want to
The rise of the wise got suckaz droppin like flies
When you a G nigga, peepin the prize from these eyes

""Low down.. niggas"" ""What?""
""Low down.. niggas"" ""What?""

I ain't down to Earth I'm in a stratus and I love it
Too many broke haters in the city not above it
Yea I'm self-made, that's a scholar
If you didn't listen one in one thousand gettin' free
Where is your tuition
I think I need a maid
Cuz I'm kinda getting paid
And I don't feel like cleaning up
I'm going through a phase
So I look for all my days
To be enjoyed with a women like me so..

Where are the real women? (Where are you ladies)
Show me the real women (Where are you ladies)
Where are the real women? (Where are you ladies)
Show me the real women

I drink Pellegrino water guess it's something about the bubbles
Do you want the simple life or do you want trouble?
Do you want the hood or do you want the good?
And don't you wanna be treated like classy women should?

Closet overflowin' all Jimmy Choo's shoey
Float you like a buoy
Spend without a limit

See how it match your shoes and how it change ya mood

And leave you hella happy that's exactly what I do

Do Today,The Book of David,2011.0,"Four, three, two
Let's count it off one
Now we gon' show you all to have fun
Get dressed and hit the club about two
Ima order me a Henny and a brew
And Ima grab two girls or maybe three
Now get on the dancefloor with me
We wanna know what you came for
I wanna see you get it on the floor
Now we gon' push out about five
I'm feeling your buzz and beehive
Now lets go get some breakfast at six
Out in front of the diner, we taking pics
And I could see the red eye, it's like seven
Got the engine in the Tahoe revving
Pick up the check and bounce about eight
Now it's time to put you up on the plate
Honey, I'll be the 6, you'll be the 9
I gotta have you again, you too fine
Girl, you better than 9, you're like dime
On a beautiful scale, you get a ten
Because you don't take up with all men
You got me lost in time, it's 11:30
And your body's like heaven, it's so curvy
So just one more time, you assume
So we can both be asleep by noon

What are you gonna do today? Let me fly you to LA
Where the sun never hides behind the clouds
You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 405 now dipping
Whatever's on your mind is what we gon' do now
Oh yeah

I like your cinnamon buns dipped in Deréon
Feeling the jeans just busting the seams
Make the K fiend, but what ya game like?
Looking at you baby, I see ya frame right
We on the floor with the girls off tequila
Sexy, independent, party going divas
That like to drop it low, stop and go
Push back that ass, girl don't stop that show
Party hard, make a toast
By the end of the night doing the most
I'm checking out ya pedicure package, ya well-managed
You bilingual? I hit you with the Spanish
(¡Soy Culo a Negro, me dicen mandigo, con la culebra grande)
Yeah, I'm international, now you know
Loving the black and brown, I do it all

What are you gonna do today? (Yeah K)
Let me fly you to LA
Where the sun never hides behind the clouds (They gotta call they travel agent for this one)
You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 405 now dipping (Yea)
Whatever's on your mind is what we gon' do now

Now the Hollywood glitz and glamour
That's just one aspect, Still pack your camera
Cause we got projects, just like Atlanta
But you might get seasick, so bring Mylanta
Cause we got marinas and yachts and big mansions
And bubbly pouring on the patio I'm dancing
I kick it with Prince, but his house he was jamming
Plus I didn't have to fly out to Minneapolis
It's the metropolis, it's where they topless
It's where we party in the evening where the cops is
House of Blues day, Key Club Tuesday
Sunset cracking a lot harder than where you stay
They come from the I.E., they coming from Sandberg
They coming from Phoenix and Las Vegas where the sand burns
They coming from 'Frisco, they coming from O-HI
They coming from Memphis and Detroit and NY
But all of 'em fly

What are you gonna do today? Let me fly you to LA
Where the sun never hides behind the clouds
You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 405 now dipping
Whatever's on your mind is what we gon' do now
Oh yeah
What we gonna do now, babe, is
Party, party, party, baby party
Party, party, party, baby party
Party, party, party, baby party
Party, party, party, we gon' party
Oh yeah, whoa yeah
Party party party, like, Uncle Charlie
Whoa, whoa-whoa yeah ye-yeah-yeah
Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa one time
For you mind now baby, oh whoa, uh",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-do-today-lyrics

To all the ladies in the house
To all the ladies in the house (good afternoon)
To all the ladies in the house
To all the ladies in the house (good evening)
All the ladies in the house
To all the ladies in the house (good lord)

To all the ladies in the place with class and taste
Allow me to place my hands on your waist
And we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie
On the dance floor boppin' with me
To all the ladies in the place with style and chase
Allow me to place my hands on your waist
And we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie
On the dance floor boppin' with me

Now I'm not barely Alvin Ailey
But I make fly dance music daily
I may never dance the ballet in the Valet
But you just might see me two steppin' the valley
If that's a real expensive car in the alley then it might be me
Playin' hookey from your local TV
But I'm flyer than an EB, extraterrestrial biological entity with Elliot but you call him ET
Now let's get your BMX ready Let's ride it out
Let's do me like drew Barrymore and let's hivey out
Give me to call home, let's dial it out
That could cost 320 million dollars a minute, now why wait
Why not just call me gray?
Why not just call me Blake?
I spend enough time on the airplane
Why not just call me Frey?
Why not just call me late?


To all the ladies, to all the ladies
From the 80's, up in Vegas
To all the ladies from 90's
You can find me wherever I be
I'm still gonna flow 2010
Still gotta about two thousand to spend
Haters in the place can't erase my grin
Stuck on my face when I'm with my friends
When I bust a rap to a DJ Quik beat
We get green just like Bill Bixby
Turn into a beast and you a beauty
Know I'm a player, will you recruit me?
I got game, and you got to tailgate
Let's have a party, girl why the hell wait
Let's have a ball, get her up from the table
If she don't wanna dance find one that say...


Now what?
Ice Cube, DJ Quik
It's DJ Quik and Ice Cube
20 years in the making
A whole generation

What up homie?

Now off of two-fifths of drank (drank drank)
They got yo' boy lookin for a bitch to spank (spank spank)
Baby you can kick it but ya sister cain't (nah nah)
Runnin 'round smellin like a septic tank (ewwwahh)
Girl you need to stop you know your ass is stank (stank stank)
Runnin 'round beggin all the baller for bank (bank bank)
Tryin to hit a lick but like that you cain't (nah nah)
Cause everytime your ass come around I faint (wooo!)
People get to passin out;
I'ma give you one more chance but yo' ass is out
Now don't you bring yo' ass back smellin like raw trout (trout)
Cause everytime I see you I'ma bust you out!
(Here she come, look out!)
And you niggas with the demos (demos)
Man you just as bad as dem hoes (hoes)
Talkin bout your record comin out (out out)
But you need to put some gum in your mouth (hell yes)
Cause before I hear you rhyme or you get a beat from Quik

Yo yo this Shyheim, and y'all can suck my DICK!
Son you owe me, fuck the dough I want it in blood
You was my homey, showed me nuttin but thug love
Put me on to the game, bought me my first chain
Let me ride shotgun, in your Benz and Range
I'm thinkin how this big nigga gon', go against the grain
Hit him up when it's foggy outside, about to rain
It's about to rain teflon cop-killers
But we ride teflon can't-stop-killers
I thought you was fam 'til you switched the love
Now you, rich and fuck, you forget the thug?
Heard you on the radio, but I ain't get no plug
And if you come around the way, I should get you stuck
I wish you luck, I'ma make you kiss the gun
And I ain't gon' stop until my justice done
What you wanna be labelled as, a coward or a duck?
What powder you cut, you wanted that building for what?
When you rep that building, what you said for that building
If it wasn't for me, you woulda been DEAD in that building
You don't know what it feel like to say I own that building
Get dough in that building, or control that building
You don't know that feeling, you ain't condone that killing
Cause when the cops came, you was like, ""Shy in that building""
I remember the days when you was shook in them buildings
You in front of these buildings, frontin like you build them
When Scrams was home, you was on his dick
And you gave that bitch money cause you always been a trick
You know Shy Da Kid, I'm back on the block
Bought the crack in the spot, spit back in the block
Fuckin clap at the cops, if I'm rappin or not
Whatchu gon' do nigga? Shoot or get shot
I'm hot on the block like new Glocks out the box
All y'all fulla dope, at the bow(?) .. what?

Yeah yeah.. yo
Kweli, I'm rock this body and so forth and so on
You can get the dick, one to grow on or one to blow on
Bet you Quik get his dough on, I spit kick the flow on
Got swift shit I throw on, cause I'ma leave what I float on
Plus I get my roll on like Baby and Mannie Fresh
After I go on y'all niggas'll never bust like tantric sex
The universal nigga that represent the planet best
How I manifest from Brooklyn to Los Angeles - people!
We hold this down like wherever you're from
Got my name all in your mouth like you pierced your tongue
Pimped the game so hard we leave them whores numb
The more I come, Kweli, I'm bout to blow like George Young
I'm the Don Cheadle of rap, dope like arms and needles of crack
My lyrics attack and arm the people like gats
In Cali studios we rest the heat up on the console
Peep Hollywood niggas who think it's sweet like Comanco
Claimin they gangster and street like they lookin for beef
But with a gun in they teeth they just MC's lookin for beats
Y'all don't want trouble, we pop bubbles and flex muscle
Niggas don't respect the lyrics, they respect your hustle
The industry is like Kinko's, makin copies while you wait
And the people always scream for NEW SHIT, like Clue tapes
Y'all speed this in your face, slow down like Screw tape
Cause as long as you rockin with Quik, nigga you straight",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-tha-proem-lyrics
Only Fo’ Tha Money,Way 2 Fonky,1992.0,"Sometimes I just don't even understand
Why people like this dirty talkin shit, youknowhatI'msayin?
But since they do and people buyin this shit;
I'ma kick it like this
You see a pimpin ass nigga like me is wanted dead or alive
Because I jack these hooker hoes for they ten's and they five's
And twenty's then I leave em branded, cause I'm the love bandit
I'm not tryin to be mean I want your green or you'll be stranded
Cause you know it don't pay to play for free yo
So you shit out of luck, I need a buck to fuck
You duck, ho, bitch, tramp
And I don't take no food stamps
This is a reminder - I'm lettin you know that if I get behind ya
You're gonna have to kick up - or eat a dick up til you hiccup
I treat yo' ass as if this was a stick up
Cause you ain't nothin but a pick-up
Trick hell yeah I'm offensive
A spin around the bend can be expensive
And the effects'll be, they can be extensive
So if I gotta fuckin take a chance, I want my grip in advance
Because it's Only Fo' Tha Money
Chorus: repeat 4X
Dolla bill y'all, dolla bill y'all
Dolla dolla dolla dolla dolla bill y'all

Now that I fucked, I want my motherfuckin cut
Oh yeah, I'm a ho, what you think I gave you the dick fo'?
See I can play the bitch, but see I ain't the bitch
You better checkin her in, and better do it quick
See the devil made me do it, cause devil is you
Cause I done seen all the shit you took niggas through
But not me wench, you cute saditty skanch
Think I'ma be the trick nigga, well bitch I ain't
Cause I'm the type of nigga that can get your cock
Without payin you, but straight be playin you
BITCH - I thought you knew better than that
See it only fucks you up, when your weak game lacks
Manipulatin moves like I do (like I do)
See it just goes to show you ho you can't play a true
See I can leave your broke-ass fast with your cock all runny
(beeeitch) cause it's Only Fo' Tha Money
Chorus

Now that you know me, I'm only out to leave you broke and lonely
I find a stupid ho and talk her ass to matrimony
Now I can be cool until we hitched
But I'ma switch up on my role and play the motherfuckin bitch
Waitin for the mailman to come around
Oh youse a low-down nigga - naw man, I'm just a money hound
I play the roll well, check out my limp
Yeahh, I'm the County Check pimp (aww that's you baby)
Slangin my hand inside your purse
Girl you better keep cool cause the shit can get worse, damn
Yo' check is short, I ain't gon' sweat, huh
I take the kids lunch money, yeah - bet
And borrow ends from yo' family and grin
I just gotta keep my bankroll comin in
And then I kick back and laugh cause it's funny
Ha ha - I only did it Fo' Tha Money

Sex Crymee,Under Tha Influence,2002.0,"They got an ATM in the strip club
And when it's all trick money every crisp dub
Switch your mouth put a dolla on a bottled water
I'll then blame on a fight with a man's daughter
When you see us comin in, pat us down playa
Cus we ain't goin for that muthafuckin shit later
Lookin for the hoes, all the best you got
It's little Quik and I come to spend a knot
In about a hour I'ma be a proper groom
Mike Bezy getting sculled in the upper room
Top Dog taught me this is how to go
If I ain't havin fun, what I'm livin fo?
Whether a barberry coast or a batch stars
Or at first kings, we in a hundred thousand dollar cars
We ain't doin the worst, we be doin the best
Now what's up with the manaché sex

Try me (Try me)
Take me to your room and ride me (Ride me)
And baby when you're through, you can hide me (Hide me)

Take me to your room and ride me (Ride me)
And baby when you're through, you can hide me (Hide me)
I wanna be your new Sex Crymee
Now what you talkin 'bout?

We be all over the states, lookin for the greats
Hoes with the reputations for having cakes
Puerto Rican mami with the black in it
Whole booty looking like a heart with a crack in it
Cabrini green style, say it three times fast
Before you do you in love with the ass
Top Dog, Playa Hamm bought her out
Show these L.A. niggas what we talkin about
She wanna give you pain till you feel it
Claimin that you came on the Peni and the cillin
Get down on it like Creeton with your thang
3 or 4 tag team really ain't a thang
With a...She got game
I love you like stranger, sex infinite
I need you like a magma for a few minutes
Pull your panties down some or at least to the side
So I can Slip 'n Slide
I like to lick you're paw prints
I wanna show how raw that a jaw gets
Bang down on ya kidney and it all hits
That's it take it off do raw shit

You actin like you ain't tired
You make me wanna just stay up all night doin this shit
You actin like we ain't both gotta be somewhere
When you first put it in that's the...that's the best part
Doin it without a rubber like if that's smart
Balls in ya jaws, lovin the walls you crawl
Pillow case bitin and I'm inviting you all
Tell me, what's the best form of stress relief
Some head in the bed or some Ecs to keep
And I'm lookin for the broads that I saw in the mall
They got my number told you I was about to call y'all
I beat your pussy like you stole somethin
Bringin you down slow humpin
I'm losing my religion, just like Pac
Lookin for a broad to get up in the cock
Cus a G ain't shit without a bitch in his bed
And money don't mean nothing if you're rich and ya dead
So I'm slappin the cheeks
And while you niggas scrappin in the streets
I'm smackin in the sheets

Catch 22,Trauma,2005.0,"Ain't nothin like poppin the brains on a Corvette
With your pet in the passenger seat
Ass at your feet, askin if you can pass her the weed
(Faster please) California masterpiece
Recorded partially in New York
With a blue spark on a purple plant and I worked your aunt
(She loved it) primarily under the circumstance
Don't be mad, I was bad, she was better, sweaty palms
But I bet her and she told your moms and wrote a letter
Now they comin back to get off of the curb
Because I swerved on her (beat it bitch!)
I ain't never been shit, that's what my mommy said
Now they callin to check to see if I took the gun from under my bed
She don't trust me, I don't trust me, my psychiatrist don't trust me
And I ain't called 'em back, I hope the cops don't come and bust me
I'm feelin lusty and my purple video tape is trusty
But I can't go to sleep with lotion on because I might get musty
I ride motorcycles and crash 'em on purpose
Into a crowd of bystanders so my insurance policy won't be worthless

Now quit that bitch shit, we gon' fuck you up mayne
We gon' fuck you up mayne, now get the fuck outta Dodge
It ain't gon' work mayne, we gon' fuck you up mayne
We gon' fuck you up mayne, don't make me pull the pump out the garage
And posse up mayne, we gon' fuck you up mayne
We gon' fuck you up mayne, you must be high on that sherm
But you gon' learn mayne, we gon' fuck you up mayne
We gon' fuck you up - WE GON' FUCK YOU UP!

Bridget Bridget Bridget was a girl that I knew
But she's a dumb ho, and baldheaded like DJ Pooh
Her saggy body tried to crash the party like Mobb Deep
With her elephant feet
I got a whole lot to say but it won't come out
Probably because I got this 38 in my mouth
And I'm pissed, I'm 'bout to nut up, fuck you nigga shut up
Like Mausberg, I'll leave your chest burnin on the curb
Hennessy to XO, crashed in the Lex-o
I make the bridge flex 'til these bitch niggas let go
And I'm upset because I'm all alone
Homies don't play by the rules, fuck 'em then I'm glad they gone
Pluck 'em out the flowerpot, flush and make they shower hot
Blister and scour, I'm pistol-whippin with power, make 'em holla like chicks
Out in L.A. ain't nuttin good to talk about
Except dead homies, and how in '82 we had all the money
That's Freeway Rick and that C.I.A. shit
22 years later, it's just some ol' player hater shit
How many gangs can kill people under the age of 12
Get snitched on and go to jail, for another 22 years
And who gets recognized for pouring out the beer
And how many young blacks drink and smoke to cover they fear
It's fucked up


I made my momma a promise that I would make it home honest
She knew that there were no problems cause she could see right through it
She know I'm deeper than half of these niggas, flyer than most of 'em
And that's as clear as you can see from off in your coast
And you niggas don't understand these 16 bars from within
If being dope is an abomination then I am a sin
Cause I'm fly like the wind, and I'm high to the end
My enemies are my used-to-be friends, where do I begin
It's a sesspool of stress, you cowards drink from the well
Got no energy for haters, you suckers can't give me hell
Cause you whack and you stale, and you act like you bail
You talk that shit 'til you gotta prove shit, get smacked when you fail
In the midst of it all I'm just persistin to ball
While these haters tumble and stumble and bumble and fall
I'm the key to cut your meter off, I'll blow what you worth
And befo' anything else on this earth - YOU'LL GET FUCKED UP!",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-catch-22-lyrics

The one that I make
When I give my thumb and other three fingers a break
You get the One
No, It's not random, it's not a mistake
You get the One, yeah

Man, ya'll rap cats funny
I'm Fred G. Sanford, y'all big ole dummies
And I ain't about to spit up on your verse
If you can't pull a little somethin' somethin' out your purse
I'm a vet, not a pet
So. Cal Intellect, grants me a much fatter check
So, oh shit! I'm back up in the booth again
This time, no looky-loos gettin' in
Please, see it ain't no reasonin'
You're bland, your pimpin' needs seasonin'
I'm one of the best from the West (Tweed Cadillac, baby!)
My name's still tatted on my ex-wife's chest
And I don't have Jungle Fever
Neither do I need a rapper rapping with me either
Ya best realize who you're dealing with
I'm on some 9-3-point Tweed Cadillac

I don't understand y'all niggas
And I know y'all don't understand me
But if I have to clown y'all niggas just to light a little fire
Well, I guess that's just what it's gon' have to be
Ya see, I don't comprehend y'all suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and you're OG
You couldn't keep up with the city so you move out to the desert
And you wanna blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

You see the gift
Now find the gab
To each it's reach
If I don't cop, it ain't mine to have
I'm tryin' to be as clean as a Stacy be
But in the back of my mind, I'm like ""get the fuck away from me""
Why do you want to try to stress a muthafucka?
If I throw you a P at you, nigga, catch the muthafucka
Here's the dearly, and there's the departed
The only time I like to fuck you is when I'm off that narcotic
You know I'm no good
I get my money in the hood
Tattoo

Oh yeah

Hey Quik! Blow a trick out
Ain't it fucked up when a bitch coughs while your fucking and spits your dick out?

Money

Give me more—no, Quik, I'm serious
Ain't that the same nigga that choked a bitch out with a gray unicorn?
Holy fish scale!
You mean to tell me, you'd rather save this bitch than save this whale?
It's mighty skeptical
Quik, man, all these years and you ain't gave me a Pee
Nah, I'm talkin' about the vegetable
And she knows it's me when I'm pullin' up
'Cause my car goes Vroom Vroom
And her daddy's easy to talk to because the whole conversation be Um-hmm
Now buckle down for the backlash
Why they call DJ Quik DJ Quik? ... that fast!

I don't understand y'all niggas
And I know y'all don't understand me

And you wanna blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

You niggas buyin' meth, I'm buyin' cookware
I'm tired of being a muthafuckin' pall-bearer
I think I'd rather be Geraldo Rivera
And tell the people what's really going on with you squares
How could I lose my identity?
How could we become our own worst enemy?
Even at the park, we don't party whatever
Not familiar because we're barely hardly together
Cyber gangbangers, Internet gimmicks
How did all my fans get replaced with critics?
Went to sleep and woke up in a world full of limits
And being humble is synonomous with being timid
Niggas annoy me, so I frighten them
They stalk and hunt me down, 'til I enlighten them
And then they sex play me, sounding fruity
When you call me bitch ass nigga
Is that a female dog shaped booty?

I don't understand y'all niggas
And I know y'all don't understand me
But if I have to clown y'all niggas just to light a little fire
Well, I guess that's just what it's gon' have to be
Ya see, I don't comprehend y'all suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and you're OG
You couldn't keep up with the city so you move out to the desert
And you wanna blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-broken-down-lyrics
Poppin’,The Book of David,2011.0,"Up in the mornin'
I keep it pop-pop-poppin'
Even in the evenin'
I'mma keep it pop-pop-poppin'
When I'm in the city
Gotta keep it pop-pop-poppin'
Down in the underground
Keep it pop-pop-poppin'

Aye, got the nine-milli automation
When I take aim at the game, penetration
Freeze, stop comparing me to Dre
Before I come through with the scope on the K
And decorate your house with you flesh
Nonetheless, and open of the best, not the stress
Cause we came to get more
Nuh-uh, we ain't takin' less
And I ain't detoxin' wit' it
I'm hotboxin' wit' it
Get it, got it, lit it
Drop it, get it, got it
Niggas stay exotic, we got Henny and hypnotic
Party on the strip, after party at the strip
Party at the St. Regis multipurpose room wit' a grip blood


Hey-hey, my thoughts slurp is steep
I'mma die like Michael Jackson too
Cause I don't go to sleep
I'mma get it up
I'mma play it like a volleyball and hit it up
I'm gon' keep hittin' these switches 'til it's settin' up
You see my Gucci belt, and my Prada shoes
And my Louis scarf, I gotta lot to lose
I gotta lot to say, but I back it over 'til I pack it up, drive away
KK

BlaKKazz back in ya ear today
Classic gettin' airplay
All that you gotta say, maybe it's a comeback
Naw, we didn't hear that
Evolution nigga, True Q and True Black
Hey-hey


Careers gettin' shorter, soundin' like it's strainin'
I been around the world boys, we maintainin'
I'm BlaKKazz packin' a backpack wit' sumin' in it
To blast back all the wack pats, bad back
I'm fired up like L.A. Hillside burnin'
Inspired men learnin', the women lower lips yearnin'
Now see me in the streets or a stage show
Reside me off the radio or Nike commercials

Got 'em runnin' like Herschel, Walker
The stalkers playin' on my cell, I'm about to call the chalkers
City full of male groupies, Eazy said it all first
All you weird bearded queers, you can meet the Fockers
But call first


KK, why are people so mad at Los Angeles?
How weak of you to let a city make you scandalous
That's pretty basic, I'm disgusted with this hatred
I'm a Compton city patron and I think this city's great when it be poppin'
Now notice that I'm called a patron
If you translate that to Spanish then we all gon' be here late
And we gon' eat up like a banquet
We gon' finish what we drankin'
When you wanna hear some G shit I'mma call my nigga K and get it poppin'
It's 187.fm, now keep us locked in, that hood shit
24 hours a day, we knockin'
K been my friend since a kid, when we lived in Compton
We bang in anything you drive, bitch hop in",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-poppin-lyrics

Four deep in the Lexo (Lexo!)
Rollin chrome and all wood (Mhmm)
All up in the wrong hood
Where bitches is no good but pussy be so good
Now that's your wife but that my trick (Yup)
And if you taste rubber then that's my ooh
Don't panic, I didn't bareback her

I slip on my rubber out the cover then I proceed
To give yo' little thick ass what you need

You got that see through style that I can stare through (right through)
Produce a track on you, I don't care to (I won't do it)
But I'm sympathetic to your needin'
Cause it ain't me your wife keeps turnin' down
While she's tellin' you she bleedin' (she's lying to you)
It ain't my fault I'm lookin' 23 and twenty-fo'
All day long hottest tracks rockin' any show (true)
Notorious for making bitches horny
While you lookin' old walkin' through that corn lookin' corny (look at that nigga)
And it's more than obvious that you're jealous
But don't hate my style, don't hate my money, don't hate my fellas
We do what we gotta do to get where we're goin' for us
To be where we need to be at...believe that
Stop beggin' for a beat you can't afford it (uh uh)
They hotter than them pretty red Dada's I be sportin' (uh huh)
Cause I got the home court and when I'm rappin'
On my own tracks mothafucka I feel like Jordan!
Music cuts off
Music returns

Now what lack that I'm the realest
On top of game you fuckin' my vibe off with them homosexual ways
Me and my nigga...we on some new improved shit
Makin' you groove shit, get paid and move quick
Nigga you gettin' mad cause I'm shakin' my belly
In a stretch navigator makin' moves on the celly
Talkin' to Stan, Tone and Quik on a conference call
Get ready dogg, you ponic 'bout to take off
Took the crown back, tucked it and ready for war
Bustin' over 2 cars, a house note and probably more
I wanna see the Madd Rapper step in my hood
So I can take him fo' a shit and all them coward niggas good
Love madresta, Kam and Crunk Dogg
Respect a nigga who done been through war
Sportin' a battle scar
But there's a lotta fake niggas, sportin' a fake crown
Straight up out the swapmeet, bustin' on wack underground
Music cuts off
Old man & young man Speaking
Music returns

Yeah, uh
I been around the whole damn world in a day
Partied wit players and haters, told 'em the rules of the game
Some in the vein, like this shit is a drug
You can catch me in the new 500 on dubs
I'm up in the club
Wanna get naked and smoke
Notice, you never see a nigga there when he broke
UH UH!
Somebody told me these hoes wanted to hold me
If a real player dress like Goldie, y'all niggas throw in a oldie
SHIT!
Niggas wanna clown, clown, clown
You can find me at down, down, down
Dot com, bring ya mom (uh huh)
She wanna see too, cartier see through
Poppa in the beat
Oh shit, it's a thrill

8:37 PM
Yeah
Smelling good in here
Pacific Standard Time
Look at this y'all look
Drankin'
This what's happening

No. 2 is for pencils, so I'ma do instrumentals
I write in my head, I still see too much potential
I’m throwin’ them parties, the ones you remember
In 1999, from June to November
I’m walkin’ round in my sandals, but I’m getting shit handled
With or without the scandal; yeah, I’m getting shit handled
Im too old? No such
Too funky, pretty much
That's whats up, nigga
Partying in L.A., niggas showin’ me love
They brought me 12 drinks and I threw up in the club
Are y'all gon' kill me? Am I gon' kill myself?
I go too fucking hard, I need to watch my health
See, I need to brush my teeth and shit
Lay off this leaf and shit
Before I get a DUI
See you high — Yeah, I'm high
Finicky people wanna hold me as hostage
I do about face and walk right into my conscience
Gold around my neck, ain’t nothing on my toes
A bunch of white powder, ain't nothing up my nose
I’m a geek I suppose
I’m a freak I suppose
I’m whatever you want me to be this week I suppose
Yeah, it’s getting, it’s getting, It’s getting kind of hectic
It's getting kind turnt and all these hoes getting naked
I'm toasting my bread, yeah, a toast to my bread, yeah
A toast to my homies, now let’s go eat and get fed, yeah
I’m feeling kinda loaded; yeah, I'm feeling some buzz
Yup, I'm filling my red cup, we 'bout to go bottoms up
Nigga don’t understand me, he’s a goddamn liar (Why?)
'Cause if he don’t comprehend me, he’s probably too damn high
Do you understand Porsche?
Do you understand Mercedes?
Do you understand buses and parties with fine ladies?
You still don’t, playa? Then I guess it’s good
I'm like that German writing you see under my hoods
Not in my hood, but up under my hoods
Be as stupid as you want to like they taught you you should
Niggas is 18 percent of population in school
50 percent suspensions, explusions — that shit ain’t cool, partna
School is free, life after that is not
Asphalt pavement is cold, tension in jail is hot
Muthafuckas In my neighborhood grew up to be nothing
I went around the world stuntin’, they still there doing nothing
And now its Three's Company on my planet
I'm kicking Chrissy out and keeping Janet
Thats a brunette, Moet — Who’s next?
Go check
Hey homie, if you don't mind, go open the door for those bitches

Huuuu
You killing it
You doing it just like i showed you
Remember if these people don't like you
That means they see you as competition
They adversarial
Just keep the secrets and let them keep on talking

Standing on the top peak, I climb to get some leverage
Opposition in my cup, tossing down the beverage
Put me in the boat, the bottom filled with holes
In the middle of the O, I still make it to the Coast
Cause we gonna party hard, and we ain’t in no rush
Got me trapped in this balloon, waiting for it to bust
See, this life that I'm in, workin’ for what I want
All these trendy things that everybody always be on
But see I'm only on me, that's why I stand out
Always things that's in my way but love they way they pan out
Man, this life is so crazy, nose is smelling them checks
I'm just making music 'til i know what I'ma do next
The labels know who I am, y'all ain't gotta be worried
You could read that we winning, nigga, and that's a true story
Man, I came so far, I just never acknowledged it
I throw you my creations, I just love your astonishment
I'ma be me to the death of me
And I'ma keep 100 to the death of me
I love to love, did I mention that?
But sometimes these niggas tend to make the tension bad
I keep it honest, don’t be mad at me
But I don’t really like to talk 'cause I don’t like to speak
And when I say that I keep you aroused
I'm that A-1 getter, know I put it down
'Cause I’m that getter, I’m that getter, I’m that getter, yeah
'Cause I’m that getter, I’m that getter, I’m that getter, whoa

Pope John Paul II, rest in peace
That was a good dude
He took a bullet and didn't even complain

I've been closer to death than pallbearers
Mutual disrespect is the sum of all terrors
I'm smarter than Maxwell, you'll get 86'd
And 99 is not a problem, she's my bitch
Baby mama named S--, she got a foul scent
Get swiss cheese like 50 but she won't get a Cent
I'm sayin' different shit that you niggas ain't used to
The shit you can fuck, smoke, and drink your juice to
In South Cali, from Watts up to the valleys
I'm a Manhattan a lot, shoppin' in the alley
And I didn't really get the props a player deserves
'Cause I'm a country talkin' city boy with balls and nerves
Who - swerves in a sports car, two seats, no friend
Two feet on the gas pedal, burn the whole street
Police line-up, mugshot with a jheri curl
Bad since the '80s, fuckin' all the ladies
Sometimes bareback, sometimes with a rubber
And my dick still works, I'm a lucky motherfucker
Let the top down, shut the shop down
Pull up to them stupids that hate you and just clown
All the way around, hit the block on three tires
You ain't gon' be here that long, nigga, so set a fire
Roll that blunt up, put that gun up
Party like you dyin' and you tryin' to get done up
One last time, every night 'til the sun up
If livin' keeps you livin' have a drink, keep the fun up
'Cause life is shorter than a nipple on a midget
So I'd rather be mackin' shorties, gettin' a smidgin'
And pimpin', I was helpin' niggas like it ain't shit
Now that a player want his money back, these niggas wanna split
But you dirty niggas is cursed, you under a spell
I could give more of these tapes away than Suga Free sells
What the hell, that's dirty water under the bridge
I just hope the pimp ain't out here havin' ugly kids
I forgive you dirty niggas, yeah fuck what you did
You wasn't shit to begin with, that's what I'll end with
I got this other homie, I'mma call him Napoleon
A born loser, fuckin' groupies all in the colon
I can't give you nothin' 'cause you lie like a perm
And you ain't black, you be passin' for the tequila worm
And Donzelle Ru, a true Piru?
Can't nobody fuck yo' baby mamma like he do
Bootlegged ""All Eyez On Me"" before it came out
Then Lip socked you in yo' head, all yo' bitch came out
Niggas wanted you stuck, Jack tried to warn me
You wasn't my homie, you was only out to harm me
You wanna preach God sellin' weed on the side
You just a has-been gangsta hitchin' a ride, you bum
I ain't name droppin' just for keepin' the hustlin' poppin'
I ain't ass kissin' and I ain't on a crash mission
I just ain't bout bein' burnt, chillin' on the oceans current
Keepin' away from niggas who say they down but really weren't
The only nigga in my family with talent
I'm a prince and I'm dope 'cause I'm funky and gallant
Gallant meanin' I like bitches and like fuckin' with fashion
Lookin' for jeans with pockets deep enough for my cash, man
I'm legendary, I ain't bitin', I empathise

She wanna, get up on top of some D and make it soft
She wanna, ride around off in my big beige Coupe
But she don't wanna go and kick it with her own age group
She wanna, hit the dodo 'til it make hers eyes tight
But her, I.D. photo picture's on the right side
So I, told her ""get somewhere and jump you some hoop
Or hop some jax with your buddies 'stead of flirtin' with folks

She wanna, hold the record for the most play things
That she done stuffed off in her nani 'fore the age 18
She wanna, pierce her navel 'til it hurts like hell
And play it off and pierce her tongue too 'cause she like girls
She wanna, wrap her leg around the pole and go spin
Until them pills that she swallowed really start to kick in...
She wanna, ride in a Bentley 'cause she heard they the bomb
She wanna, lick on a sucker 'til her lips get numb
She wanna, find a goldie that she know she can dig
And then go eat some grits and eggs until her ass gets big
She wanna, go adjust that look to fix her hair
Then go take some pictures sittin' in that wicker chair
She wanna, let the pimpin' know she down to bone
But when it come to her I.D. she done forgot it at home
She wanna, knock a O.G., tell her girls she done got him
Then go into vivid detail 'bout his two-minute problem
She wanna, drop her peachy folder down on the ground
And then go get a Maxim magazine to show that she's down
She wanna, let these players know that she ain't no kid
So go put this wristband on bitch so we know who you is
She want a diamond bracelet, a diamond necklace
A diamond party at thr Diamond Club with a diamond checklist...",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-gina-statuatorre-lyrics
Underground Terror,The Red Tape,1987,"So you waited and waited and waited, now you comin’ on down
With a hit to get an underground tape you can’t escape
Because you bitches you like the *tracks* and you niggas like the *tracks*
Put on my tape and hear the jam, it’ll make you say *goddamn*
Yo, we can do this like I blew this, getting loose like Spruce
Oh yes I’m able just like Maple, face the realm, nigga, this Elm
And the suckas can’t stand it, yo, I’m in demand
If a crook broke in your shit, he’d take my tape and leave your band
‘Cause the Quik is not a sucka, not your average muthafucka
Pass the 8 and get it straight when duh- dadada-duh-duh- duh
Take the time to play a funky ass track by yours truly
I’m runnin’ over muthafuckas like a dually
Jumpin’ in it to win it
‘Cause I’m in places a tampon ain’t been yet
But niggas call me grits and shit, tryna fade
Stay down, fool, ‘cause I’m long paid

“Underground arsenal of terror”
“Now…”
“Underground arsenal of terror”
“Now listen…”

KK on the trigger, niggas better duck
You played around, fool, and your ass got stuck
Don’t even try to fight, you know you’ll get bucked
Oops, I caught you slippin’ now your ass got fucked
Treated like a pooh butt, trained like a slut
Without the Vaseline, straight meat to the butt
Now, with your booty, you know I need my cut
Fuck the damn money, I get paid by the nut
Hit the switch, got the grip
Chrome to my side, don’t even try to trip
Now the K’s on display, going across the land
Knockin’ boots, I’m the root with the loot in my hand
Second to N-O-N-E, None
I’m the one on the run with a gun and I’m stunning the rest
The crowd, I do it loud
For the hood I’m down, but now I’m rockin’ the underground

“Underground arsenal of terror”
“Now…”
“Underground arsenal of terror”
“Now listen…”

Yo, I’m kickin’ shit, so much shit that it stank
A young nigga that’s making a bank
Got these bitches on my nuts like a shell
‘Cause a nigga like The D serve it well
So get back, you little sorry muthafuckas
Eat a dick, you little short dick bustas
Yeah, I serve the crowd the bomb ass yayo
And when I roll, muthafuckas lay low
You wanna be a nigga like me, you gotta be down for your crown
And claim your spot, G
And what I preach ain’t quoted from a Bible
If you know like I know, it’s all about survival
‘Cause bitchmade niggas don’t scare me
And if you lesser, then the gat don’t try to tear me
See, The D is out to break the street barrier
Comin’ up with that…muthafuckas

“Underground arsenal of terror”
“Underground arsenal of terror”

Alright, check it out, y’all…
[Outro: DJ Quik + 
Gangsta D
 + (KK)]
Ah yeah, all over the muthafuckin’ underground like fluid
And right about now, I’m here to tell you how we do it
My boy KK is in the muthafuckin’ house
My boy Deon is in the house
Better known to you muthafuckin’ tricks and bitches as The D
You know what I’m sayin’
AMG is in the house talkin’ that pimp comedy shit, you know what I’m sayin’
And we gon’ run this muthafuckin’ underground just like this
Yo, we ain’t ever forgot about none of our homies, you know what I’m sayin’
Ah yeah, over there…
So all y’all muthafuckas out there, eat this dick, you know what I’m sayin’
(Any muthafucka on the underground that thinks they can get some, come with it)
Fake muthafuckas
(And that’s KK saying it to you…)
Oh yeah, check it out, I would like to say
Be looking out for Quik’s album and shit, it’s gon’ be funky fresh
2nd II None gon’ be doing our thing single, AMG strong as ever

Takin' the chips out
Bringin' the chicks out
Heavy Dizzle, my big brizzle
Gave me a tip to make my music sizzle
Uptown, any town, any city, out of town
Make a nigga throw on his record and watch him get down
You did that, now you get that props
From a skinny nigga in them Compton shacks
You rocks the low-fade, then rocked plats
You even helped Biggie go from gold to plat
Just a superstar throwin' off fast
But you went supernova galaxy past

Quikker Said Than Dunn,Balance & Options,2000,"My name is Quik yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Quik or just call me Q
But It doesn't really matter to you
Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin' I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I co get ill
But I'm like that and thats an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat thats playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Quik's doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some yo
It's Quik-er Said Than Dunn

Wooooooo! Wooooooo!

They made it easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model nore a Dr. Seuss
But i'm not a gangsta and I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the Q-U-I-K comma
Now thats drama so pay attention
By the way I must mention I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare but you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the Q on the Compton tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Theo is a dj not a lawyer dope fly employer
On the (static) thats my station
To get the money, the women, while we dippin round tha nation
Boy, Mister Quiks of toys
I mean str8 while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gone still my name if ya don't even know me
(Dj Quik: Blak Tone) (Blak Tone: What sup)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at and that's just the sound and next time
I'm peelin ya cap to let ya know where I'm comin' from
Quik said it and it shall Be Dunn

Wooooooo! Wooooooo!

Creatin dope jams are the part of the cycle
Quik-er said than dunn yeah thats the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(Blak Tone: but would if she's ugly) If she come she a ho
Don't ask to battle me home boy
What's that you wanna battle me boy
Ya better be strapped cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
(*gun shots*) now that's what I'm sayin'
Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellaz would annoy me the ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do I wishin' nothin' ladies do
Cause the ladiez I luv 'em nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Quikster cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy its Quik-er Said Than Dunn

Just a Quik Dedication

Seen a nigga smile so i turned and asked, why your mouth got so much plaque, thinking you the shit all young and sporty, can't wait to see your grill when you turn 40, im a sex symbol and you can't pronunciate, but 2pac passed so they sing it anyway, stretching pintos yah, you flossing poorly, you need to pump yo brakes, yeah slow down whodi

This is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you

Yeah they say ya'll smoke cigar shake, that's the craze, cut open a blunt lick it back and blaze, over hurr, over thurr, that's the catch phrase, skip the bathwater, ya'll be dirty for days, brown weed, gold teeth, hit the floor now, robitussin all in your cup got you slowed now, let the streets tell it nigga word of mouth, 'cause ain't nobody catching no colds down south

Where u from nigga yup had to beef, acting all mad, mad dogging me, yeah i know you got the bombest weed and palm trees but you should of cut that f**kin' curl in eighty three, when girls come around you don't even flirt, busy throwing up rags f**kin' up my concert, why we be busy making paper chasing cheese, you still set trippin' off them b's and c's


There ain't shit you won't do for a record deal, why we be making moves, you be keeping it real, why we comparing bank rolls, you comparing skills, one more thing man back wood skill, you wanna be famous nigga, sound like us, gotta copy the west to go platinum plus, when i come through the east and hang homie i swang, i leave my radio 'cause ya'll don't play us out there

What the hell ya'll hating for, can't a young player make money anymore, without having to be from the south or east shore, this the gangland bangin' is paying a g more, nate dogg he done busted your girls bubble, compton and long beach together now you know you in trouble, taking death chances bangin' to show that we true but still

Jus Lyke Compton (Clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Finally got a chance to leave the C-P-T
Off to other cities to trip
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs... a local brother made good
I made a name off of making tapes for homies in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin and shootouts and bangin and trip
All because I came out with a hit, check it
Nineteen-ninety-one, while everybody else is smokin the splits
I was thinkin of the fonky hits
About hoochies and playaz and gettin drunk and off that bud
I was doing the things they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And that they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of the gangster class
Where you got blast and knowledge, that's a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in Oak-land
And brothers was kickin up sand, to them bangin ain't nothin new
And slangin ain't nothin new
And for every sucker we done shot
They done shot two
Straight doin dope since the sixties, before I was born
Families of hardheads mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay
Keep your hand on the clip
Becaue Oakland... 
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland... 
Moving on to St. Louis, where they thinki they be buffin
With gold teeth in they mouth but they still know whassup
And the summer is kinda hot
Hot enough to make ya cuss
And that's why I stayed on the bus
But later on when it cooled off we came down and made a couple of friends
Who put us up on the St. Louis cap
The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich
And a couple of hoochies
Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store
He put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
Cuz later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin and shootin -- in Missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?
Now St. Louis... 
Yeah y'all, St. Louis... 
I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin that ""Colors"" and ""Boyz in the Hood""
Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the Shaw
But now, back to the story that I'm tellin
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin
When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits
When I'm thinkin bout hors d'ouvers, and cowboy boots
I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest
And San Antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test
And before it was over the show got deep
A fool got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin of scrappin
Little did they know that we was packin
Yeah, we was puttin em down and scaring the rest, yo
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest
Now San Antonio... 
Yeah, San Antonio... 
After a month on the road
We came home and I can safely say
That L.A. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of suckers in a town like this
Have such a big influence on brothers so far away?
But still my story ain't over cuz I got one more to tell
And the people of Colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show I did in Denver
With a first time promoter, it was done in a skatin rink
Hoochies was lovin us, but suckers was ready to bust
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind
Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my guests
When it was over two niggas needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being nothin but snitches
Now Denver... 
Yeah, and Denver...

But I love ‘em thick like Demi Mo’
Now I need my piano player—where did Kenny go?
El Dorado rollin’, got your El Camino stolen
Taking off your 100 spokes to sell ‘em to the old man
‘Cause they look a whole lot better when they rollin’
Double it back onto your block to come pick up your woman

That ain’t your fuckin’ business, stay out my lane, mayne
‘Cause don’t nobody wanna see my game plain and simple
Them little niggas do the damn thang, mayne
Yeah, they’ll be dumpin’ out the Maxima
Throwing flaming hatchets at’cha
Tiger claws scratching at’cha
They tighten you niggas up and then throw the ratchet at’cha
And when you mark niggas flip, we the spatula
The 88 degrees with the lucky number seven
It’s woop music on your block, knockin’ with my brethren
I mold you into the shape of an octahedron
While inspiring to be your headache aspirin—Excedrin
I’m compelled to find every word that rhymes with orange
You might be bouncing the door but I’m the door hinge
I’ll knock you out and in, go to the mountain then
Exclaim it out that that nigga Quikster is ‘bout to win
Ol’ bitch ass nigga  said he’s never heard of me
You’re nothing but a buster, insignificant nerd to me
Yeah, nigga, word to me
Keep gum-bumpin’ I’ll bust your head open where the curb should be
You’ll be talkin’ out the side of your neck on purpose, G
Gave him wounds in your torso, you fade out worthlessly

Ain’t nothin’ but DJ Quik, my boy KK
Doing a little dedication to the neighborhood that raised us—the Hub City
KK reintroduce yourself

You don’t know me, bitch; just wish you could
I’m KK with the cat from the Compton backwoods
With a city full of stars, wannabes
Young G’s, rats, euro Cutlasses, ‘Lacs
Dippin’, swervin’, niggas still servin’ yay
Through the valley of death, best keep your wheels turnin’
Look and learn, tweed burn by the minute
Trickin’ the private throats, can’t if my hustle ain’t it
Man, get wit’ it
I shouldn’t be reasoning the rules
It’s harder by the second tryin’ not to use the proper tools
But fools get sent to school with all that tryna clown
That junk poppin’ too much could get’cha tossed around
And broke down by necessary parts
Brains, balls, dick, and muthafuckin’ heart from the start
You niggas underestimatin’ skills?
Sittin’ back talkin’ ‘bout “Y’all niggas ain’t real”
While all you hookers lose your will, we chillin’ in the zone spaces
Business ain’t concernin’ you, so stay up out our face
The chase on, hold it tight when on the mic
You ain’t actin’ right, off with your lights

This is so Compton—it’s so Aranbe and Spruce
It’s so Kemp Street, it’s so Rosecrans
So muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so 105 Freeway, east to west in the evening
Too muthafuckin’ Compton

You know we blowin’ tweed
Ain’t no need to mention drinkin’ fluid
You caught up on your water, well now you’re going through it
That’s a blast—I’m a not the type to do it, turn in your player pass
Ya blew it—take that there, chew it with your slow movement
I’m paced, KK style but true to it
220, but now you know the time gon’ blow it
Search yourself first, girl, then go for it
Calm down, way down before you throw it
Hold on, disinfect your mouth ‘fore you choke it
Now ain’t no jokin’, before I start pokin’
You gotta stop that tweakin’, tryna kiss me and loc
Yeah, bitch, back on the scene
Cut black clean, blessed, unstressed, and still lookin’ 19
While haters I went to school with, they to the curb
Like exes, when I see ‘em, they be frownin’ with no words
I don’t deserve, rumors unheard, never Hollywood
Guys, my bodyguard is why I’m solo through your hoods
Now to the blunts, it all ain’t good
You the type to bleeze stuck up in your fantasy, bitch

This is so Compton—it’s so Gonzalez Park
Muthafuckin’ Compton—it’s so Lueders Park
So muthafuckin’ Compton
So Jim’s Burgers, so Dees Liquor

Hey, I’m live, I’m givin’, I’m livin’ it
See or it or be it as you may, you know you can’t fuck wit’ it
That keep it real wit’ it—man, I’m standing here, the truth
And being KK without something to prove
Everybody got something to lose
When the button get pushed and it’s you, it’s getting battered and bruised
Then there’s nothing left to do, except for you
Sitting at home, phonin’ the black and blue
Now why glorify a killer or thug, gangsta banger
Then run and hide, terrified, fearing the danger
I’m remaining the same
Bald head, black, part of the original West Coast rap gang from Compton
Pacific C, California—one of three West states that producin’ that stankonia
I’m putting that 2nd II None on ya—now move, muthafucka, ‘cause I’m…

This is so Compton—it’s so Aranbe and Spruce
It’s so Kemp Street, it’s so Rosecrans
So muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so 105 Freeway, in the morning or the evening
It’s too muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so Jim’s Burgers, so Dees Liquor, so neighborhood
This is so Compton
It’s so Centennial, it’s so Compton High, it’s all to the good
So muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so Black Tone, it’s so Big Ducky, it’s so Quik’s hood
Too muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so Tree Will, so Big Chubbs, every last hood
So muthafuckin’ Compton

The Maze,The Trauma Mixtape,UnKnown,"Bloods kill blood, Crips kill crips
Mexicanos kills bloods, everybody trips
The weed ain't workin, so we all take sips
Road rage, 9 millis, 7 in the clip
L.A., L.A. where have you gone
It used to be a time when we had it full grown
Now it's, more killin'm, like its no more chillin'
Worried ex-dope dealers, paranoid villians
Pissed off nigga shoots the shit out of a kid
Gunnin' at the cops 'til they open up his fuckin' lid
We ride or die til we really fuckin' die
You know hes goin', you can see it his eyes
So, drink a forty when you hoped he could be saved but
Tomorrow party with a hole up in his braids what?
Ain't no love up in the city
It's only hatin' faces
You should appologize
That way you won't catch cases


Now, if you kill a rapper you'll never get caught
Yes, I am a rapper and I always fought
I fought for what was right
Now I gotta bitches and niggas hatin' me because I'm outta sight
And I taste just like castor oil to you
But I'm not a bitter person, pass the rolls to you
Hit the blunt, it'll pass the spoils to you
Wake your brain up, that's what is spose to do
Now, Black Tone keep me off with spruce blonde
I'm a send chicken coup over there
Cause Barbara Bird got 2 blocks
I ain't studyin' you dumbies cause I got
2Pac bangin' off in my cassette deck, I'm a shut up
Gangstas die faster than teachers
And I can see the whole game from under the bleachers
Guess a whole lot of mad rappers walkin' around Los Angeles

{Act like you got some class, and stop showing yo' ass
Sho' nuff, sho' nuff, sho' nuff, baby mama mama mama}

Yeah, you can catch me in the drop top 'Rari that's the meanest
And then hit the block on some powder-coated zeniths
Pocket full of money and a snub-nose toast
And I can't help it that I'm so West Coast
Can't explain mine, in shape for game time
Showed you how to shine and soo-woop at the same time
With a D-boy demeanor and a coke flow
And it's C.O.D. when the coke go (gone)
And you squares amuse me that, give it your best then fall
And who need a group because, I possess it all
And y'all love my wits, pull up and impress 'em all
A hall of famer Blood, I'm one of the best to ball
(Aw~!) And err'ytime they count Mack out the picture
I grab my nuts, flip them haters off and get richer
Smashin up the boulevard in a red two-seater
Chicken Hawk, DJ Quik, and the shit off the meter - burnin up

That's how it's done, that's how it is
Niggas lights camera action, this is showbiz
And Hollywood's too big a place to be dreamin
If you've had your dream shot down to the ground, you know the meanin
Now that's the conduct, that's what we all about
I had to learn to cut, you better call 'em out
And bring 'em right down to the floor
So we can give the motherfucker what he came here for

Sho' nuff, I said, it's too much ratchet shit goin on around
Yeah yeah, baby... Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Act like you got some class, and stop showing yo' ass
Sho' nuff, sho' nuff, sho' nuff, baby mama mama mama

That's Mack 10 (OH!), he's my constituent up in this shit
Compton to Inglewood, I think we need another clip
It's goin down like the helium's missing
Analog, that's the way I listen, I'm Louie V hoodie
+Mobb Deep+ but I ain't +Goodie+ (oh!)
I got a plot to get the dough, 12 GA dot double lot
Hit the flow slow, stick up or kick up daisies
It's all go, rhymin' and stealin'
Grimy killin', 21st century chillin'
They quick to try to ask Quik how I'm feelin'—I'm still a villain
In Hollywood tryna make my millions
The molly's good, got me stuck to the ceiling—I'm floatin' high
And I don't research nothing, nigga—I review it
I seen it all twice, I know how to do it
I'm movin' that double the speed of light
Third passport, poppin' Ambien on international flights

That's how it's done, that's how it is
Niggas lights camera action, this is showbiz

I like legal tender, that's both of them
Money AND women, you know my gender—now send her
I'm like Em, got a grip on my balls
Middle finger to the world screamin'

I smoke weed then I spray the Febreeze
Mix it all up like some fondue cheese
I'm FLY - and this should let you know how
I never wash my ass and my face with the same towel
Got niggas in my hood that can't even buy gold
But swearin' up and down that they ballin' out of control
You niggas is fakin' (oh!), actin like they got cocaine bakin'
With a fuckin' day job at the train station
And they gotta reapply every year for that job

Gettin' blazed off N-deuce point tres
And I gotta say
Bout damn time we got a station in the neighborhood
That ain't scared to play what's all to the good
Theo keep it poppin'
Afternoon drive in your ride while that ass on that deuce keep droppin'
Right on beat, but it ain't KISSnet
It's 92.3 and Theo is the shiznit
And Compton's in the house once more
You're listenin' to that n*gga Quiksta and your homeboy Theo
Tryin' stack paper like players and gents
Cuz if it don't make dollaz, it don't make sense
I gotta make that money to the left of the decimal point
While I'm blazing up the rest of my joint
With this fat neck givin' up the fanny
She let me hump her, then I dumped her
Now she's calling Lisa Canning
Left the motel listening to the Love Affair with Jammin' James
Like Luther say: Keep it right there
Playin' oldies while I'm scrapin' the walls
There's only one station that's fadin' them all
And they let us call in...

You don't need no Viagra or ExtenZe
Cuz when the dick's good
They put their cushion on your front
And they swing it from left to right until it ends
But then they all catch feelings and the Psycho shows
And that's when they become those passive aggressive hoes
Talkin' bout flippin' it with what she do with her toys
You can't put nothin' in my bitch! I'm a boy!
And if you keep annoyin' me
I'ma pump yo' pussy full of lead
And poison all your ovaries
I'm fly
Too fly
I wish it made sense to say Three fly
But can't because I'm high
Sterile from the barrel
So that means that I'm clean
And I'm so cool I can nut ice cream

Come get up on it
If you get it, you gon' get it
You know how I get when I hit it, I split it

That N*****r's Crazy 3x

Niggas in L.A. they talk just like a bitch
Mouth open like ho's pussy
Complete with the drips
You lucky my security don't want it to pop
They looking out for you niggas
If it was me, you'd be dropped
Real men don't gossip and real G's don't plot
If they started what they started
Then they start it, don't stop
If you had as much money as you niggas had words
You'd probably be up on it 'stead of down on the curb
I'm a legend and a playa and a gangsta to boot
The only banger with the key to the city in my loot
I'll put a spell face over me that'll screw up your luck
If you put your mouth on me, potna, you'll be stuck
That's the voodoo that Pirus do
That fly crews do
That fire on tired niggas that block cock like you do
Killa and a prophet, Nostradamus with Glocks
I put it at the trial, only my hair is in locks
Now kick rocks

You wanna know me, You wanna know my mind
I like to make dope beats and hear dope as lines
I like to drink to this cup and have a down ass time
I like multiple bottles, empty, but all in a line
I'm a star, you can only be a co-star here
That should be cool considerin' that you wasn't shit last year
Super Cocky Disc Jockey used to fight like Rockey
I'll Apollo Creed ?_____?
Make you bleed if you mock me
Checkin' niggas on Twitter who want to brand me as bitter

Sellin drugs to my other sisters and now I hope
They break in her fuckin Buick and pinch on her dope
I transferred out of Compton High School with a gun in my pants
Ready for whatever comes and I'm prayin
I ain't gotta be the one shot up in the hospital
Simply because Compton never had one, fuck it
I shot them niggas and I moved to another town
Gave the gun to Darryl and I had him go melt it down
How many times did they call me a fag
'Til they got stomped out and threatened with a 44 mag

We gotta freak the freak the funk
We gotta seize and squeeze the pump
We gotta tease and beat these punks
Get on your knees 'til Jesus comes {*BLAM*}
Give up the keys, get in the trunk
And if he freeze, begin to dump
We gotta smash and kick and stomp, blast a punk
Get on your knees 'til Jesus comes {*BLAM*}

Dwellin in a house full of lazy psychotics

How many niggas did I shake for bullshittin?

And I drink imported beer while I'm lookin for the gear
I'm a stylist, I'm not a porn star
I know enough to where I can service my own car

And lovin how they fall, this music is different

In time. You can't be...You can't be he-ey you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be let you be my playmate. You can't be he-ey
You can't be my lady but I'll let you be let you be my playmate
Now ain't nothin' like tight pussy on my dick
It's the Gangsta D baby never saved a trick
Got a harem full of hoes mashin' to the studio
With all my niggas you will get busy hoe
Now the first bitch she want dick to the tonsils
My second & third wanna f*ck on the console
My fourth start to leave like the Duke was shootin' shots
While my money maker walking the stroll for my knot
Got that bitch mouth smellin' like fresh cock
Young toit If I can smell it I'm a tell ya to get going
With a douche pack you're makin' my nose react
Reekin' but that ain't tweed or no yak
More like 25 pounds of get back & I can tell by ya
Walk it's talk back but if that ain't yo case let me take a ride
On yo' love rollercoaster pull them panties aside KK
I'ma lead it to the left & to the right & I'ma
Make ya scream & holla for more & I bet
You when I'm in it you can't help but to admit it
You ain't never came this good before
Chevis-Regal got my dick so hard I ain't gon'
Make it to the house because that's too far
Mr. Quik give me the keys to the Benzo
So I can hit it right here on the E-Lo Haaaaa Baaaaby
I'ma get some pussy tonight as soon as you turn off the lights
I'ma get some pussy tonight as soon as you turn off the lights
I'ma get some pussy tonight as soon as you turn off the lights
I'ma get some pussy tonight as soon as you turn off the lights",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-medley-for-a-v-the-party-medley-lyrics
Intro,Death Row Sessions [Bootleg],2008,"I just wanted to be the first to say that 2Pac was a really nice man. He was fly, 'yall. He was mellow, but at the same time he could be Rikers Island wild. He's a very tight dude, man. Of course you already knew that through the music you could tell what he's about. He tried to change the game, fix it and my lil' homie's life was cut short for some bullshit. And I miss him. I never want to make no money off of you 'cause I love you so much. I wouldn't even put records we did together on my album. Do you feel me?",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-intro-lyrics
Dollaz + Sense (West Coast Classics Radio),West Coast Classics Radio,UnKnown,"Now let's get down to business, bitches!
'Cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin' to diss this
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Nine, ten—Eiht, you can't win
'Cause all the way around, nigga, I gets respect
And you's a nigga that can't even get no props in yo' set
Tragniew Park you say, huh?
Wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin'
So listen close, 'cause I don't want y'all to miss
That I'm 'bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
Acacia, Poplar, Maple, Spruce, Cedar, Elm
Westside Trees sprayin' all the fleas
That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders
(So niggas watch yo' ass at that center divider *gun blast*)
Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame
When I caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game
You looked up and you seen my niggas comin'
And you looked like yo' bitch-ass was 'bout to start runnin'
But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation
(Yo, whatup?) And see if we can fix this little situation
But would I fuck you up was what you wondered
Yeah, that's probably why you
Changed your little pager number (punk-ass!)
But bitches like you don't grow
You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
And callin' me skinny, you's a clown
I'ma call you Theo 'cause you weigh 92.3 pounds
Wack-ass actor, movie script killer
Fool, don't you know? Quik is still the nigga
Compton psycho, boy, you oughta quit
Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
You need to stay down, you Compton clown
And get off of the nuts of the niggas with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'ma boot yo' mothafuckin' ass to the Moon
You need to quit bangin' under false pretense
'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the C-P-T
No, better yet T-T-P, or the niggas that look up to me
I make it my business to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever, well, that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand
That there's only one DJ Q-U-I-K
With no C still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and
Depositin fat checks and
Gettin' mad sex while I floss the NSX and
Doin' what I wanna, and you's a goner, nigga
For thinkin' that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin' 'nac with all my niggas 'cause it's to the good
So don't knock it 'til you try it
'Cause Eiht, he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket
So put the P in it, represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa
Let me take a load off my scrotum, little pest
If it don't make dollars, nigga, you know the rest

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie-ass niggas keep on ridin' the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik
Ain't your average everyday motherfucker (hah)
Slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon' be the first, you little trick-ass ho
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck
'Cause when I caught yo' ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence you left speedin'
You ain't no fuckin' killer, you's a comedian, beyotch!
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin' your set a bad name with your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue?
Yeah, you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin' on the Westside
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side
Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a real killer
Tell me, did you feel a little nervous? (hell yeah)
You was in the shadow of death
With two trey-five-sevens pointed at your chest
Hmm, whatchu gon' do? Where was your niggas that kill at
You ain't got no killers, so kill dat!
Holdin' up your hands and beggin for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass
'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
I'm through playing wit'cho punk ass
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

Shouts goes out to my well-known road dog
What's up Donzelle Tru?
They don't understand it, baby, they can't fade us out here on these Compton streets (beyotch!)
It's bigger than they can imagine
To the whole entire Death Row family
Both sides, whassup, niggas?
And my nigga big Suge, known for keepin' shit poppin'
To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-C, little straight G
And that little singin'-ass nigga Danny Boy
Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this
I'm the first nigga that was ""Bangin on Wax""
Yeah, if you remember, 1987 underground tapes
And it don't stop, and it won't stop",https://genius.com/Dj-quik-dollaz-sense-west-coast-classics-radio-lyrics
