I said sail real
Get alive and build. Head up!
On the sea or maybe uphill
Got 20 battalions oh you’ll do my deal

So who shot at ya? Your staff sergeant
Came up witcha. Pull on it

Rammellzee And Shock Dell At The Amphitheatre,UnKnown,1983,"[Intro: Shockdell]
...
With the master plan, you can't understand
And I don't stop, that body rock
And keep, a keep rockin' the sure shot (Crazy hands, Crazy Legs)
Keep rock, rock rock the rock rock
Keep rockin' the sure shot
Rammell, my mellow, my man
Just get on the mic with the master plan

[Verse 1: Rammellzee]
Well I'll rope you to a decimal
When a shaolin crawls down Cypress Hill
As I turns the dawn up, to see my boy
I drink a whiff of riddle for the widdle toy
To my writing on the wall, the def graffiti team
I told the sucka nigga he couldn't make the cream
I got on the mic, yes, I had a night
I shocked the sucka nigga to the break of daylight
All breakers out there on the floor
Rock with the rhythm, with the freaks galore
Put the music out with the apple pie
Shockdell and me, you don't
You guys get on the mic, so I can chew
Serve them with the funky bass in your face
New York City, have mercy, have mercy, one time
Introducing the crew, me and my mell C
I'm from the Rockaway (Mr. Freeze, Mr. Freeze)
And my man Mr. Freeze on the shock
Yah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Do-do, do-do it


[Verse 2: Shockdell]
So you're unemployed, evicted from your home
Street bumpin' bumper, ain't happenin' grown
All alone, on your own, pushin' ups and downs (Check out)
Put on the round crown, all rhythm through the crowd
But that's not the way you intend to live
Receive, but don't fear, now you're after it
I puff the cheeba in the rain, snortin' blow in the snow
Your momma don't know, so it can't hurt a soul
He can't escape the world, been prayin' his life
There's got to be a better way, you sit up at night
You can pass the tracks, there's more that you deserve
Keep on bumpin' to concern, praise the rich and up in there
Hip, hop, a hip-hop a hip-hop
A hip-hop, you don't stop
You can freak it all night to the sure shot
You can freak on top, to your delight
Rammell, yo the king, so
Get on the mic and do your own thing

[Verse 3: Rammellzee]
Won't you just get on down
Yeah, party people out there in the audience

Just the name of your trip, with the serious tip
My move science, my move science
Gonna freak to the rhythm, yeah, makin' you pop
Now baby, oh baby

Now to make you get down, and I got so much
So groove it to the rhythm, a sure shot
Rock it, yo, it's really hot
He's got, oh, the serious cock that'll make you great
When he shakes your butt, on the wheels of steel
A Grandmaster D. St., shockin' it on the beat
Rock quick, y'all, yeah
Rock-rock rock rock, rock rockin' it quick
Funky music, oh, with the serious through, yeah

Once again, from the T-O-P
[?] rock it down from the top of the key
My name is Shockdell
I wanna be known, wanna be the best on the microphone
I wanna be based, and crawl the seven seas
And jumpin' off the top of all the sucker MC's
To be among stars, to be on the top
The A, number one, and king of the clock
The Sly Casanova at the top of the hill (what you know about, jack)
The cold-hearted lover with a heart of a steel
The savoir-faire, the women all admire
The long burnt fire, and the passion and desire
To my, beat-beat, to my break of dawn
To my, beat-beat, to my break-a-dawn
So Rammell, my man
Just get on the mic and do the best you can

[Outro: Rammell]
Pull out your pocket, pull it out your pocket
'Cause you know I'm down, yes, I best rock it
When I shock with the Rhythm Rock Steady Crew
To the best of my ability, that'll make you move

Beat-Bop,UnKnown,1983,"[Verse 1: K Rob]
Get funky in the place!
Get funky in the place!
It’s pathetic dope addicts have to be abused
It’s a shame what a day to be a prostitute
Life is given to us just to do the right thing
Instead of that we came a ho or a big dope fiend
Make you feel real bad every time I see
Another bum or brother sleeping on the street
In the corner in the morning every night and day
It’s a pity so many people try to act gay
Everybody’s turning crazy so you’d better believe
To do the right things or soon you’ll see
Life ain’t a moral joke it’s a serious thing
When you’re dealing with the answers that you can’t explain
New York City is a place of mysteries
Drug addicts dope dealers taking over the streets
That me is always saying why the hell do we pay?
What for they break the laws and get a couple of days
No sense tryin’ to help there’s really no use
Think of us messing up lectating at you
Hot rocks tryin’ to pop with no respect
Niggas waiting at the station for the big pay cheque
Home boys going bakin’ on Thursday night
Girls waiting in the house for Mr. Right
Kids going to school just to be a fool
Never want to learn work just a polin’ on you babe
It’s the funky beat and it’s the funky beat
And it’s the funk, the funk and it’s the funky beat
Yeah

[Verse 2: Rammellzee]
This is the mellow they call the Rammell
That rocks you with the rhythm that’ll shock your spell
When the shake-up kid that wakes you up in the morning
Gotta rape with the rhythm like a number one groanin’
MC quick just to make your peanut butter
Shock with the rhythm of a number one undercover
Break it up just shake it up rodeo uh
Break it up just shake it up rodeo uh
I’m the mellow D down with the funky sound
That can mace your brain with my diamond studded crown
Just a makin’ you dip like a little bitty dive
Live a prick just bakin’ your hide
Rock on to the break of dawn
Just freak that yeah baby
Just freak it yeah baby
Like the little jelly-bean I’m a sweet like a candy-cane
Make you get down just the number one stain on the train
Just groovin’ like a say john
Just break it up yeah yeah stay john
Like a roller coaster ride that can make you bump
Just groovin’ with the rhythm as I shake your rump
You gotta rock rock you don’t stop the baby y’all
You gotta now rock and you don’t stop
Just hip-hop the day they doo-be-doo
Yeah Scooby Doo what you wanna do crew

Just freak out, yeah baby
Just freak up yeah, yeah baby
Drink it up yeah, I know my dear
I can rock you out this atmosphere
Like a gangster prankster number one bankster
Got the much cash to make you thank you
Rock on to the break of dawn
Break of dawn, keep it on keep it on
I know ZZ that can rock quick
Like a iconoclast had your rhythm to the stick
Just a rock on like the finger lick
Finger popping hop popping now don’t stop bunny rock
Bunny rock and you don’t stop
That long finger nail at the end of my tip
Of my pinkie cocaine make you slip a my lip
Just make you freak when a panny wanny with clip
Got the little pat to the dab’ll make you my hip
Shake shake rock body rock the hip and the hop
Like RPM’s my
Nose don’t care about the rhythm that breaks
Because the music is down when your body want to shake
Gotta hip hop and then baby dog get down
Let the rock just shock your dome
Just break it up, shake it up yeah baby
Cause the groove just rocks like a little shady
Get shade yeah, shade it up with the glasses
Make it on with the serious pattern
Get the melody quick, yep the melody sound
That’ll rock you quick with the number one crowd
I can get up on the groove that make you shake down
Cause the beat from the depths of hell make you get down
Rock on, to the beat
Freak it on, freak it on with that kid unique
Just check it out, check check it out
I said I broke into a dun Seville yeah
And then I shot across top of hill, with the chill yeah
Break it up Cypress Hill, shake it up
With the writings on the wall, I don’t give a fuck
Just jam it up, rock on you don’t stop
Jam it up, rock on you don’t stop

Freak it on freak it on break down don’t stop
From the depths of hell, rock well Rammell

Cause I’m a jam up hip hop making the tip top
Shake on the break down the needle on the eye
Grooving with the rhythm of the break in the tie

[Verse 3: K Rob]
Smoke cheeba, into whores, drinking all week through
Never want to go to school and that’s a fact
Till all of a sudden you got left back
Now you’re feeling real low and mighty hurt
And your friends are snapping on you like you’re a jerk
Now things are hard and you’re really depressed
And your mind can’t function cause you can’t pass the test
You’re saying to yourself what can I do?
I can’t go home, I might as well quit school
Jobs are hard to find everybody knows
And you can’t do crime cause you’re on parole
No education is a big disgrace and
So you might as well work at the sanitation
Can you get my drift?
Get funky in the place

[Verse 4: Rammellzee]
I know the man that gets with the deal
That rocks like the pimps that acts real real
He can get real ill when you’re on the chill
I like the quarter drop a dime
That can make you seek a thrill
Master killer called the evil gorilla
Yes the best in the nation yeah number one thriller
I’m the best cut, rocking with the duck
Making with the conceal

Rocking, don’t stop the beat bop the rocking

Check it out you don’t stop

[Verse 5: K Rob]
Get funky in the place
Get funky in the place
What?
All the time that you been hanging out with your friends
You never took the effort to see what’s happening
Crime, crime, crime can’t get it off my mind
Cause it’s a thing we have to face all the damn time
People always say why do they break the laws
Gonna tell you right now it’s cause a all a y’all
That’s a go like ebola, gonna let it be told
It doesn’t matter to a thief if you’re young or old
Just money they wanting they need it bad
And to take another person’s life it makes them feel glad
So rock, to the funky beat
Ain’t another ain’t another that you heard yet
Rockin’ better rockin’ better on the radio set
And if you did and if you did please tell me now

[Verse 7: K-Rob]
Bust a move
Well I was coming from school it was three o’clock
Had no money in my pocket broke to the last drop
I had no way of getting home
I was really messed up cause I was all alone
I felt the real sick and very confused
And my heart was pumping fast I think it was the booze
And my legs felt the weak and I couldn’t walk
Got pains in my chest when I tried to talk
I said, ‘Oh God it had to happen to me’
‘Give me a chance to straighten up and get a day OB’
'Cause I’m the type of person who likes to play
And at the time I had a drink and got carried away
You know everybody once made a mistake
It’s not too late to straighten up so give me a break
I’ll go to church and do my work instead of being a jerk
As a doctor or a lawyer even desk clerk
Whatever you say I must do
'Cause you’re the one and only and I trust you
Crime is going up....",https://genius.com/K-rob-vs-rammellzee-beat-bop-lyrics
