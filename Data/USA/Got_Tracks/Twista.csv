I told her to ""Drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie, like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World,she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't a freak, so you gotta prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right

[Interlude: Aisha Tyler & 
Kanye West
]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
And it's good, it's all good, it's beautiful, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster, baby
Can you please? Do it faster baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast...
But I know somebody who can, Twista!
[
Verse 2: Twista
]
Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to 
Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back
 to the melody of ""Roll It Slow""
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin' me and still gon' be in love with me, and I ride...

She say she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers, need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man, you gots to roll with the plan

Then I got to bone, stay up in the zone
Got to get you home, gotta run up on

Put you in a chameleon '04 Range

Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life

Talkin about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like the girl in uhh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter yo' atmosphere
As you enter my world and let me touch that booty
I can't believe that yo' momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul, you need a modelin role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin
From the bottom to the top of the pole, cause you can pop in control
Yo' phatty's so accurate when I'm smackin it
It's makin me say ""What I gotta do to get with that?""
When it come to makin it rain I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin that monkey I can get it wet
You want some media baby you need a better man
He cover politics, I'mma be yo' weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin up and I see more ass
I'mma constantly see rain in the forecast
This-a-way, that-a-way, I'm flickin 5000 Ones

C'mon and get drunk with the money hauler

And everybody that proceed with the hatred I'mma teach 'em a lesson

I got the muscle off of my hustle-and-flow money
A entrepreneur with ways to get mo' money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Huh, it's just a lil' bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet in other ways
Then I'mma have to beat it up but first I'mma play wit'chu girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play wit'cha pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play wit'cha pearl
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin and fakin on me baby
Cause I know it take the right touch
I ain't stoppin 'til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin 'til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited, I can't hold it
I'm feelin it comin, I'm 'bout to let off an explosion (ohh)
Let it ride when I see you animated and shakin
Now when I touch your body you catchin convulsions (uh-huh)
That's when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to
You chose me, I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you

Hope,Kamikaze,2004,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers
And everybody lost period
All we got is hope

I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach us all to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on
Let's hope

Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful

I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin off the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers staying strong
You can make it whether you wit him or your man's gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priests like they did R. Kelly
And I wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that super homie Christopher Reeve could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's hope

Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always so optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King ""Why can't we all just get along""
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church
And let's hope

Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay

Mista Tung Twista,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1991,"Watch the lyrical flow
Oh! This dope rhythm I throw
Be pump pump pumping 'em up
And I'm ready be bringing 'em up at the height
With this funky tempo I throw, I know
Gotta be stopping the dope hypeness
Stop anyone then I'm bend 'em my lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue
Believe it that I'm hung among
The style I be throwin'
Is takin' em out of the sucker, deliver the lyrical-ism
And scopin' 'em up into a prison
And givin' a lyrical foe thatll fizz em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up, only my lyric was left
My tongue twista is deaf
First let me take a deep breath
Flowing the lyrical magic
I'm out to be marvelous
Screamin' and breakin' 'em up
And then makin' 'em breaking the sweat
I be makin' 'em jump and then sit up
And live with this style I be kickin', I'm pumpin' the rhythm
And rocking the palm of the lyrics up under the side
I'm making 'em like I'm a fool
'Cause rhythm I'm bringing into the mic
I'm only give 'em a concept

Heeeey
What's happenin', y'all?
This is Tyrone Chilifoot down with the funky Tung Twista, baby
Three minutes of straight stupid
Straight ignant dope funky stuff for ya, baby
So turn up your radio and get down to the Tung Twista
Kick it gee

Let the Cavalier Tung kiss ya, it's the Mista Tung Twista
Pumpin' a rhythm, a lyrical styler
My tongue'll be flingin' a funky pile of
Lyrical rhymes that's breakin' 'em off in the mind
I be flowin' 'em, holy I'm
Kickin' the funk of Islam
My lyricals slippin' 'em like petroleum,
 slowly I'm
Pumpin' the flow of the lyric
I'm breakin' em off with the radical texture
I'm one brother you could never get next ta
Flex your style
I'm gonna give 'em a lyrical pump of the rhythm of Cav
And crackin' 'em up with the word of the wise
I be bringin' 'em up in the flow of the funky dialect
I elect a flow for suckers that try and wreck
I spark the light over a head and be wakin' 'em up
And then cause a fly effect
I insist ya, lay with the path of my rhythm
And follow me like a scripture
Flowin' this from my lung, a tongue twister
Mista, my style'll be makin' a dent and be leavin' the tracks bent
Steppin' is the lyrical black gent, my 
Nubian
 accent
Breakin' 'em up and then makin' 'em take in the smell of my funk
I be kickin' up in 'em and then I'ma give 'em a lick of my
Lyrical lollypop, I'mna bring 'em up into my doctrine
Rock then the rhythm'll makin' the clock spin blackwards
The funk of the rhythm'll snap, crackle and pop, then flow, oh
I'm makin' 'em follow the path of a God
And my track'll be blacker than Cocoa
This lyric I'm makin' is dope, don't call it so-so
Don't diss the Tung Twista
Leavin' the suckers soft as a whisper, Tung kiss ya like a sister
Then I'ma let it be known that it's the way that I throw
That's makin' the funk of the lyrical glow
And how I tell it, yo Cav is kickin' a funkedelic flow
And oh my fist'll swing at the rhythm of suckers
Then I'm gonna give 'em a tongue blister
It's the Mista Tung Twista

Ha-ha-heeey
Boy, that's Tung Twista for ya
Comin' at ya in 3D
Ha-ha
We're going to get funkier than that, boy
Check it out
Kick it again

My tongue is spinnin'
I follow with Allah
And the Father be stoppin' the Cavalier from sinnin'
The lyrical rhythm beginnin' and then in the endin'
I ratatattat tactics, givin' 'em black kicks
Flow of the lyric I'm pumpin' and rappin' 'em up is dope as a crack fix
Wack? It's - funky, I'm greater
Never to step at the lyrical dictator, a state of
Shock is what I put a sucker into, then to mentally
Go with the smell I be stylin', gee, funky is what the scent'll be
Harmin' this? Uh-uh, the Cavalier's kickin' my charm in this
Simply because I'm in this, 
I'm as dope as a pharmacist
Calmin' this? Hype as a rattle be shakin' and rippin' the rhythm
And breakin' up into a sweat, I be workin' the lyrical servin a sucker
So never come near a lyricist Cavalier - ah
Rock the flow of the lyrical rhythm be shinin' like a mirror
Hear a sucker step at the Twist'
Ya gotta be goin' like this to beat me
The funk of the lyric'll flow from me like peepee
You caught a work of my tongue as I be flowin' like water
Crackin' 'em up with a flow of the sort of slaughter I oughta
To be embracin' Nubian nation, race you
Takin' my tongue you're tastin' a quick pace
And facin' lyrical wastin', Tung'll be cut like Jason, racin'
Tung Twista rock, your lip'll lock
My tongue'll be makin' a tick tick or tick tock to Nubian hip-hop
Flip-flopped a flow when I wrote this
Kickin' and makin' some hocus pocus, focus
Tongue'll be flippin' just like this I'm a locus
Givin' a diagnosis for Twisterosis
Crackin' a mouth and them makin' 'em ache
I'ma put 'em up into a coma
You're sniffin' a dope aroma
I'm blendin'
I'm able to break up a sucker that you might send in
The funk of the lyrical rhythm beginnin'
Spinnin' the suckers around like a dollar
Be makin' 'em holler kickin' the funk of a lyrical scholar
I pray to Allah, I'm makin' this funky like I'm a hobo
Throw better than bolo, ya thinkin' that he can battle my solo
I just say oh no 'cause that's a no-no
When I be smellin' the funk of my flow, jo
I'm pumpin' this up and then breakin' this in with a lyrical
Then say haha, take titles then say ta-ta
I'm rippin' and rock 'em then rockin' a rhythm
And ring in my tongue I'ma bend 'em
And flow with a lyric it's steppin' inside 'em
And get with the funk I be pumpin' up in 'em with this and it's the
Yeah - Tung Twista

Oooooweee
Haa-haa
Boy, if that ain't bad my name ain't Lewis Tyrone Chilifoot, baby
Haa-haa
But we finna  the Boogieman 
Go head, get 'em

The Boogieman was speaking, he said: what's up Mista Twista
Don't you know that Nubians ain't never supposed to whisper
Talkin' behind my back is makin' it seem like it's a rumor
So tell me face to face when you will decide to come to Juma
Don't say your name backwards because you don't like Cav
Played to the left by def and I'm gonna eff up the right half
The sucker descendant of Canaan, I'ma let my pizzazz wreck
I'm speakin' this to the devil that calls his self an Aztec
You ain't a Puerto-Rican, know what I'm speakin'
Islam you're seekin'
You might as well open the doors of a church and become a deacon
Don't step to me, speakin' the pep to me about what your rep'll be
Crept to me because I let them see that you had leprosy
Them suckers that be dissin' me I simply just insist ya
Stop steppin' against the Mista Tung Twista

He-heeey
Now that was bad, baby
But if you think that was somethin'
Wait 'till you hear the album
He-he-hey
I like to give a shout to my son, Tyler Witfoot
And get out to Eric the Wiz
Cavalier, of course Cavalier, it's his album
Ha-ha, 
My man, I'ma tell 'ya

And the DJ Cut
And the whole entire hip-hop nation
We Audi 5000

Crisis,Dark Horse,2014,"Everybody got the memo, Michael Myers, man I'm mental
Messy murder monumental mixed my mind
Metamorphosis made it mainly my many maneuvers
Missin' my malice malevolent mister N9ne!
Mediocre motherfuckers my motive makin' minimum
Maniacal makin' me mesh my line
Monster! Musical massacre
Metaphysical minion may never match my grind
When I'm bustin' you think I'm poppin' the E
Hoppin' to N9na boppin', need no stop and lockin' the B
Niggas be droppin' off in a coffin talkin' to me
Better flee, never see, Tecca Neez, I be forever
Look at the K.O.D. demolish, Im polished
I get dollars, I get the guala, mixologist, and many I sell
You will never see the light of day right away
You will die but I hide away, say goodbye (I'll see you in Hell)
True shots, a-who's stopped the crew's water?
You soft, I move rocks, a Moustapha
Boondock ya boo, Soo-Woo, what the?
Through chakras, you lost the new nana
Out with the weak and in with the raw
Put you in deep and have your mama seekin' the law
Freaking the beat, I get to peekin'
Leavin' you mauled with the saw
Ain't nobody beatin' me in a brawl
Y'all got to know, I stop the show
Pick you off of the pillar, you know I drop the foe
Sick of an abyss of sicker suckers, sock a ho'
Nigga, oh, you ain't even in my optical
I'll shock ya though, I rock the flow
Nah, not so low like burnin' optimo
Wassup to Joe from my block, the MO
I did it to death and my nigga I got to go!

It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you dont know the truth
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency, making you have to evacuate the premises, killing the audience up on the stage

We are an anomaly, coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut, if I get to fucking 'em up
I'm probably bustin' 'em up and vodka be up in the cup
And drama be nothing to us
A combination of some oddities coming to crush
And y'all will be nothin' to touch, your body, we cutting 'em up
Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted
Like we 'bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck

Whenever you recollect it, me and Tech will tackle niggas
And see em like Liam Neeson in Taken
Or Taken 2, better yet, Tekken 2
Wrecking you like I was Baek or Eddy
I'm ready to reappear like I was Yoshimitsu
From a darker side of the universe
You would verse a predator is what you didnt know
When they will go and get you
Then Im immediately about to punish him, run, it's a mutation
Of horror that'll treat you like a ho' and hit you
But Tech, me and you can speak on it, even type of terminology
And hurt em as if they didnt know we were an odyssey or an oddity
Its a murder probably, if not then I bet you that we cause a verbal lobotomy
Tell them niggas to make a move, then when I move, I wanna bruise
And show 'em they finna lose, and I refuse to be a fool
I kill 'em and keep it cool, but I'ma do what I'ma do
Because Im breakin' the rules, lets go
Bust you with lyrics how I shoot this
Or either we gon say ""fuck you while chucking up the deuces
The booth is where the living proof is, and I'm ruthless
I can leave your whole teams caduceus in nooses, ooh, its
Somebody you dont really want to get into it with
Im mythical, difficult and I dont know if it'll
Be a wise thing for you to do as far as tangling with the unusual
Orion, Im iron, Im scientifical
Indivisibility within the infrastructure of the family
That I created is inevitable
Especially if we committed to getting money
So fuck the haters because its the paper that you better get, you
Take your mental into space and leave it alone
An outer dimension because I can get deep with a song
The look of a fiend, I'ma put em to sleep with the chrome
Unlock the machine, fuck him if he aint breathing alone, die

It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you dont know the truth
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency, making you have to evacuate the premises, killing the audience up on the stage

We are an anomaly, coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut, if I get to fucking 'em up
I'm probably bustin' 'em up and vodka be up in the cup
And drama be nothing to us
A combination of some oddities coming to crush
And y'all will be nothin' to touch, your body, we cutting 'em up
Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted
Like we 'bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck",https://genius.com/Twista-crisis-lyrics
Sunshine,Kamikaze,2004,"When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
Y-yeah, keep my mind on my
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger, stayin' on the grind
Now when I wake up in the mornin' I gots to hit a lick
Saw the 2003 Navi' on Spre's with a kick
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin' the block and dodgin' the one time
Peep how we movin' them rocks
And the pounds of dro before I double my shit
I can serve 16 ounces for 6 and get back 96
A killer for the scrilla, nigga, best not be stalkin'
I gots to get them bigger figures, fuck what you talkin'
I represent the niggas ballin' with jewelry full of sickles
Down to the niggas chasin' million, the dream servin' nickels
And I know one day, I'm gon' come up
And when you see me, don't hate that I rolled up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'caine
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs
Gotta get some money, mayn

It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

A hustler's definition is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
I got a clip full of hollows, money-makin's my motto
Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle 'til I hit the lotto
With dreams of ownin' a record label, flippin' words
My nigga flippin' buildings better than he was flippin' birds
I got the mentality and the motive, I'm on a mission
For the money, you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans and follow procedures
Into the 600, blunted with a pocket, full of hundreds and Visas
Love when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up
Love when I get that gig, get a crib
Get a car when the grips stack up
And still in the evenin', if I'm sleepin', paper products
Soon as I get up, it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money, mayn

It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' Jags
Got love for the thug niggas who get it on the Ave
Love for those who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine strippers who get it poppin' ass
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the haters rollin' bubbles
Causin' trouble every time a young brother try to hustle
And if I can't legally make a lot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
And if it ain't no work, we do a stick-up and whip up a concoction
Might leave you face down in the dirt
Because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money, mayn

It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

When I wake up in the morning, love, ohh-ohh-ohh
And the sunlight hurts my eyes, ohh-ohh ohhh
And something without warning, love, ohh-ohh-ohh
Bears heavy on my mind

It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day",https://genius.com/Twista-sunshine-lyrics
Adrenaline Rush,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"What happens when you combine the darkness with the light?

I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses
In the pain from these here motherfuckin' verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
To the dirt shit first picks and usin' autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit (just to squirt shit)
Im hitting it with an expert kick
And burst 'til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin' the curtains bitch
(When adrenaline's pumpin')
I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga, and I'm off my square
High got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit

What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge?
Im charged up like Scarface gettin' shot up on the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(So tell me what it said)
Retaliate with lethal repercussion
I feel the reefer rushin'
To go into thangs like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm finna steal
To get the kickin' shit
For niggas and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
It's like some lead bust
'Cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' heads bust when you jumped up
'Cause what I said must've got you geeked
My eyes red, puffed
From smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westside'll let the shit go on
And ride when the trigga bust

Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Pullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick
I'm ready to start shit
Started buryin' some heads like an ostrich
Unload the whole cartridge
And throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What I've accomplished
Yung Buk's my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
And started on a journey to establish to stop this
Worshipped in the hearts of all the niggas to get 'em charged
What's the real reason?
All you haters tried to murder me, so now it's kill season
And even though I'm still bleedin'
I'ma keep comin' because I'm still breathin'
And y'all can't trace me
I'm burying my victims in the wall like Gacy, too lyrical
And since the snip of my umbilical, these flows been critical
My music is miracle, it's like I'm biblical
Kill like I'm nuttier than Buddy Love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove
And start the truck up
And speed the fuck up
Getaway, smokin' the blunt up
Adrenaline pumpin' veins, erupt, I'm pumped up

And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees
See that's 300 niggas that's gon' die
'Bout 60 slugs to do this deed
(Psycho Drama)
We too much for the industrialist to fuck with this
On the brink of fuckin' up some shit
Dismantle, deduct some shit
It's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
(What niggas got nerves to do)
So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you
Then think what I'm on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo' curtains fool
From killin' the verses fool
I be one of the worstest, dude
(You the who?)
I'm the worstest
Look about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo' purpose
Bitch you hurtin'

Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Let your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

Let's have a toast, drinks on me
Summertime, drop top, wintertime, minks on me
Too cold, I'm hoping that really want me cause I
Be at you cause wanna get next to you
In the back of the Phantom, or the club in VIP or at the bar
When I see you I feel like I'm looking at a star, up to par
Just so fly
Having dreams of you being mine, cause I'm just so high
Telling all my boys that you chose me and left yo' guy
Magnificent situation, I'm so glad that I bumped you
Intense, let me close up this tense distance between us two
Cause I don't wanna go hard like I wanna have sex with you

Compliment her like a gentleman because I know that there's fly shit there
All the time in the back of my mind I wanna say ""that's my shit there""
With the swag of a diva, hot but not too flamboyant
Wishing I could communicate with her through clairvoyance
Telepathy and I could really tell her what I feel about her when I have a thought
Pretty skin and your lips look so soft, don't talk, shhh, be quiet
Could you tell what I be thinking about when you see my eyes?
They say I'm looking at you like prey
And I'm a lion and I'm finna make a move
Cause I really wanna see her on my arm a lot
Tryna be her friend, I'ma become so close I'll be her confidant
But, play hard to get and tell me why don't I just go

Do You,Pimpin Aint Dead ,UnKnown,"Huh
Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista still

Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimme a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, cuz she know she a star
Did you wanna ride in my car?

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you wanna blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?

In the mood, like yes y'all
Rather be, let it test y'all
Light the B if it's special
Can I undress to relax y'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the 5 double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough
Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?
An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this
Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Now I was geeking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a 50ball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin thru stunting why are you running
Cuz I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming thru balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb................
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cuz' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P

3rd Eye,Reloaded (Don Cannon),2012,"See you with the eye
Rather at the apex of a pyramid or the forehead of a cyclops
Talking shit to me make sure you're off the right block
Still I'mma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop
Might stop, but only if I know you I don't mean to blow you with the statement
But I don't be fuckin' with these niggas, and that's why they be hatin'
Cause I stay in the zone, I be alone, so excuse me if I'm wrong
I'm off a kush, and when the T.H.C. affect the dialect I be as free as the wind and fire
Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet, violence, silence
All the critic's when I spit it I'mma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing
And with this rap shit I'm a beast
Balling like I'm Uncle Pauly and all of the above we goin' in the club incognito with the snub
East, be the direction that I'm prayin in
But I'm a Midwest nigga
Mean with a verse, something fly- I am seen with it first
So they can say ""Where you get that nigga?""
The essence of my vocabulary's exquisite when I enter into a realm, taking me to the helm
Of lyricism, you gonna be callin' me majesty, callin' a tragedy that you gotta see on film
So I salute and advise you not to shoot, you are not equivalent or parallel to my level
Sub-par, So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil
I can turn these happy homes and these fake MC's into whole apartment buildings and vacancies
Bakeries, cook em til they done, whoop em til they wump, put a funk in them niggas
Watch what you say to me

Don't play with me, I'mma make a hater pray to me
God cause I'm hard and my flows is the coldest
You are no threat, don't step, I am a descendent of Imhotep, yes, Moses knows this
Of annihilation we are on a brink, I be smokin' up the stink, so before somebody thinks
See see i'mma start to get ugly as Michael Spinks 
 , when I rap about the Sphinx, instead of about minks
Knowledge is power so he taught you 'bout your third eye

Type of shit I make a bird swim, fish fly
Fuck it, touch the sky on the first try
Man a motherfucker could never control me
, only squeeze me and hold me
Is what the fe came up and told me, Now is she bold g?
But in my mouth is where the gold be, cause I be playin' her like Goldy
Ab-Soul I know ya know me
Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah I blow it by the OZ
I never sleep, you getting cozy
I made it out the jungle, I should write a book about Mowgli
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I hit you with a Sig, but I'd rather smoke up on a stogie
God MC, you could say I'm holy
The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so a nigga never lonely
Solo (Soulo), but Top Dawg is a army
Flow AT and T nigga 4 g's
Might be the hip hop Bob Marley, Taking shots at politicians while I roll weed
Easily Eazy-E without the Jheri Curl Juice
Off that drank that make you think every girl cute
On top of the pyramid, A angles acute
Mark of the Beast on me, him, her, and you
Money in the safe in case there's a lawsuit
Because any lumberjack would say they saw you
Me and Twista in the cut twistin up a blunt what the fuck you want?",https://genius.com/Twista-3rd-eye-lyrics
Hope Ft. Faith Evans,UnKnown,2005,"I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, And I
Wish My hommie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride, And I (I wish)
Wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
We would never break
Though they devastate
We shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on!!!
Let's HOPE!

Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful! Hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lac' that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (I wish)
That one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2*, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's HOPE

Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King ""Why can't we all just get along""
Hope we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let's HOPE

Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,(let it take you away)
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay. (i know it ain't easy)

Throwin My Money,Dark Horse,2013,"{Chris Millionaire on the track}

In the club throwin' money
Turned up, Kells and the Twista

The way she work it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
They way she twerk it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
The way she pop it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
The way she slide down on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money

Pop that booty, let me watch it girl
Drop it, I'll not knock it - better yet I'mma reach into my pocket girl
Watch it girl she sluggin', come over here cause I see what you do
Tippin off the plenty booze; 
how you be attractin' plenty dudes with the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doing takes some talent so I gotta say that I'm enjoying what I witness
My money flow is endless, lookin' at her work that pole like a gymnast
Climbin' up to the top, turn it upside down then open up her legs
Lookin' sexy all the way to the bottom, 
I'm throwin' dollars cause it look like she finna hit her head
Now she twerlin' around it, then do a split right in front of it
Ready to go back up when she look at how thick the money get
She do it caterpillar, ballerina diamond toes arial and vert
Full rockin' it verti crucifix fan kick, pro pound with mills stacks spin in reverse


I ain't got no plans tonight
Get somewhere, you can help me get my head right
And I love your swag, cause it's just like mine
Siamese, twins, me and, you, we, two, of a, kind
Strip club is our playground, she playing on her monkey bar
Up and down like a roller coaster - I call that ass a theme park
Way she handle her business from the sky she make it drop
My money no limit, tonight I'm about to go astronaut
Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me
She'd been around the pole so many times she should be dizzy
Rolex that's real crime, these niggas exaggerating
Her ass can hold a glass, that's no exaggerating",https://genius.com/Twista-throwin-my-money-lyrics
Make a Movie,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Twista, T-Pain
Lets make a movie baby

Twist got cars, big swagger
I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster
You a hot star no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride
On a journey with the one that you call daddy
Who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon' do something romantic and different
I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when it's in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my 
H2 up to your H3
You know that you want to be in this movie
So don't be acting like I'm trippin' with a strange ambition
Recording you while you loving me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me

Kill Us All,Kamikaze,2004,"Here I am motherfuckers, thought I was gone, huh?
Oh, y'all just gonna take my shit and run with it, huh?
Oh I gotta get you, I got to get you, 
my adrenaline still pumpin'
Kamikaze style, I feel like, I feel like
I feel like

Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters
Dynamite and C-4 strapped around the waist
Bloody tears in my eyes
Hit the switch making sure any motherfucker in the vicinity blow away and die
Kill 'em off with an explosion, get up bitches
Kamikaze on you hoes, I'm the sacrificial lamb
Feelin' fury flow out of every follicle in my body
While you decompose, die with a blunt of dro in yo hand
I'm uppin' the itchy for fuckin' with Twista
If you fuckin' with me, come and bet fifty
'Cause it won't be an issue
Got some nuts to come get me
Then boy you gon' get the picture for flamin' my swisher
The hollows penetrate through your tissue
Fuck your fit up with your blood
As I hear the cries of yo homies screamin' revenge
Got no mercy on them either
Go to war with the intentions to annihilate everything you stand for with the death of myself 'cause I'm a believer
The blessings of sacrifice
The messenger who cometh after the Christ
Next one to glisten after ice
Fuckin' with me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice
I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life
My brother you can't bring harm with guns, I'm armed with bombs
Fuck all that shit you carry I got your obituary
A motherfuckin' phenomenon, 'cause I'ma come
'Til they put all of us in a cemetery

Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us

Go to war like I'm untouchable
Yellin' out bloody murder while I'm bustin' you (bustin' you)
Two deadly fingers squeezing twin triggers steady touchin' you
Screamin' like a demon like I'm finger fuckin' you (fuckin' you)
Just put my body in a room with the enemy and I got a grenade
I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch
Pop seventeen sins out the gun clip
Smoking dro so fire I was on ten after one bligg
Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre
Takin' more blood than a 2000 dracula
Slip the clip in the automatic and get to bustin'
Horrific hollows while you prayin' to Jesus of Nazareth
A seven day theory like Makaveli,
 flowin' on a track that's scary
With a MAC in the back of the pelle
Spectacular
How could you dare me knowin' I'm already willing to die
I'm comin' back after they bury me
It's time for your confessions, I be the priest
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier
Better become a bible holder
As I start to massacre men with a verbal recital that's colder
Deaths coming closer
As you let kamikaze enter yo body
Careful or you'll die standing vertical
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you

Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Now come and look into the mind of a man
You don't really wanna fuck with
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Kill us all, kill us all, kill us all

Now it's time for me to go psycho again!

Rock my Gucci, Louis, Prada
Suzuki, new Impala
Like Flukey I get them dollars

Make your vision decompose
Be so ridiculous when youre looking at the clothes
Like I got a garden I was looking at the hoes
And when they saw the apparel that was when a bitch chose...
Then she froze, I be looking so fabulous
Never the one to be tested cause it'd be nothing for me
To just go in the closet to show what Im dressing like
Get 'em Im looking impressive and I'm somebody not to be messing with
How I do it is a hell of a method
And when I be steppin' up in the vicinity I'mma demolish 'em
With the Gucci, Louis and Prada that's on my body
I'mma hurt 'em with a fit that cost a lil more than your residence...
Gu-Gu-Gucci, Louis, Prada like
Sushi
, Benihana's, doushie, do don dadas
Well tell her come on I got her!
I be sick of you fucking with raggedy niggas
And looking ridiculous I could be taking you

How I be rockin' it be havin' me lookin' wet
Lyric acrobatic I'm in the designer vest
If you lookin' at me bogus Imma take it as a threat!
When you see me Im the one of a popular
When I be rockin' the fashion I be killin' the minute
And look at the women the way that they be switchin' and walkin'
And workin' the runway I'm checkin' on how astonishin' they be lookin'...
V.I.P is like a fashion show
Everybody lookin' the best they can look and when they do it it be
Swagga on a million and I be feelin' 'em
So I'mma tell her that I love how the ass look in her Prada...

In a suit we, pray to the father

Its Yours,Dark Horse,2014,"You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby
You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby
You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby
You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby

Let me get straight to it
Her body like a Bugatti, aint nothing like a Buick
When we get passionate Im in love with how you do it
No longer want to lease it, I want the title to it
I might have blew it but now I know I want to own it
And get rid of opponents but I know fame can be blind
Never knew nothing like it is so one of a kind
I know that it'll be stupid to not claim that it's mine
She fit me like a glove, hop up right on top of her man
And with no hands she give me a hug
Go ahead and reverse it baby you pop it like a drug
Asking me how I feel when I'm inside your love
Better than the mall
In other words whenever I'm up in your hall
I feel the ripples on the wall
A spectacular feeling when I get up in them draws
And with no hands she can even give an applause
Cause you got me gone, all I can say is True that
Whenever I put the soap hole inside you at
Snug, but you can see its something you aint new at
Ooh, I can feel it when you do that
I can feel it when you do that, she got a nigga stuck
Murder with the pussy now you just been cut
She got the kush in her bush and Imma take a puff
Telling me that its yours and i cant get enough
And she talkin like

Tell me that its the one
Tell me baby its the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure
Tell me baby cause you know that its yours
Oh-woah
You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby
You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby
You know that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, that its yours, baby
You Know that its yours

She got a body like a Maserati
And she got the owochi cochi like a Rochi
Ass fuck her in the back of the Kawasaki
But the flow is a classic so its probably a Harley
Hotty be better than any thot around here
I see you  that I can be your manager
My place so let me show you I can handle ya
Scarface, I fuck you right over the banister
And its the way that you be telling me that its yours baby
How Im a breath of fresh air, you been so bored lately
And how you like to be reassured by me telling you that you the one
And how it be mine and how Im going crazy
You got a nigga caught up in it, every time Im all up in it
Loving every minute, all I know is I dont wanna finish
And Imma be talking to you while I hit it when you ask me to

Tell me that its the one
Tell me baby its the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure
Tell me baby cause you know that its yours
Oh-woah
That is yours",https://genius.com/Twista-its-yours-lyrics
Emotions,Adrenaline Rush,1997," Let me play with your emotions

Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
That's what the ho came up and told me
Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be
Cause I be pimpin her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
Just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick
You better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
Cause I ain't even on that petty shit
So who the fuck do I competi with?
The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin for me pickin a fit
I got them heffer's nose red
And when we get in the bed, I be leavin em with rose legs
Stuffin that made em wanna pose dead
But you already got em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin
But it's the bomb when I be havin them cuties thinkin
I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em
Be gettin pub with em, in a club with em
Smokin dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em
After gettin paid from her she ain't trippin
Cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin with the game on ways to make mo'


(Let me play with your) emotions ho
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that...
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that

Now how the fuck you gon' act ho, I saw you creepin out the back do'
What you runnin from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow
Cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs
It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain
Pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin em up with adrenaline, got em geekin
We're speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on
With a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
A shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
Then she signed on the dotted-line, the ho was like
""Oooohh Daddy... why you doin me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head""
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up
Like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess it's cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did
But game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin to gold dig, now

Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby

I know you think it's blasphemy
But won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see
And when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy
That I can get her so gone, the ho be trippin talkin up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock
Or when I rub the twat, or pickin up a dub at spots
Fuck the ho thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin with em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
Sso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin
Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion, the grey poupon
Them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
And let me pull my pouch of snuff
In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe
And let your tongue go coastin low, now",https://genius.com/Twista-emotions-lyrics

I got fantasies of you carrying me home
Hope that you stayin' alone

Don't be playin' me wrong, I'm too grown for games
Mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa you facin' I'm strong 'cause you see I don't be really quite comin' on the same

Fuck whoever you was gon' leave with

Who you should be with, your body I squeeze quick
Stick through the sheets and your arms

Then add up them zeros and lo-dos
You ain't no 'bout them weed needs, (huh?)
Pussy feeds (what?) lex keys (damn!) for Mrs. Kane
See a half is for my mommy, fuck Tommy
He ain't tryin to ask naughty
Smooth head got you right in the bed
You need another lover like you need a hole in the head
Instead of all this talkin' let your tongue do the walkin' on down this clitoris
Fuckin' with a wild hundreds bitch
Ain't that some shit?
Guaranteed to get you wet, simple kiss from petite lips
It won't take a gang of gifts just to hit this
Come and take a little glimpse of the sweet hips
When that ass in the air cause an eclipse, on the freak shit
What you know about this slick clit
Send you in a thang when you feel this
Bitch, far from a virgin and sip a Burbon get the derb
And leave you hurtin' for certain
Steady splurgin' when I'm servin', get you wetter than a Persian
The X-rated version
I'm urgin' but I ain't thinkin' you can get it yet
But if you good in a minute you can get it what? Get it wet

(Get it wet)
Gimme some Tang and Alizé
Let me tickle your body, after the party we can pleasure
Will you come on, let me

But you be the only one that I be thinkin' of
Gimme a hug, you got me sprung in love

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Got to be more careful don't hurt 'em girl, you sexy when you mad
Then nigga come hurt me baby wet me with a splash
Aggressive loving I've never had
As I enter the scene with bedroom eyes, Obsession cologne on, Nautica robe on
Flamin' up, trippin' while stanky roll on
Herringbone on gettin' my pose on to the dome strong
Take a sip of liquor, I'm on bone
Huggin you like I ain't seen you in so long,  what's up girl?
I execute my unique approach who I be the most
Willin' to learn and try to be like I got some experience
If you need a coach or we can ride tonight
And kick it like the homies, who? Me and only you
Smoke Bs up like a cigarette 'till I can only see a silhouette
And even though you won't admit it yet
I can tell what time you eventually'll wanna let me get it what?
Get it wet

(Get it wet)
Gimme some Tang and Alizé

Creep Fast,Adrenaline Rush 2007,2007,"Police! We have a search warrant!
C'mon c'mon eh T-Pain, it's Twista come this way, we gotta creep fast

Watch as I hit it through the middle of the city in the chevy
And I'm ready with the woofas that'll flip your block
And I got the tech and a machete for the niggas actin' petty
Get to talkin' an I'm a heat up your block
If you wanna bring your boys
Better bring the toys
Better bring the noise
I'm a pump both up with ammunition
Bodies I be hittin' when I get to spittin' everybody
Shoulda broke and ain't nobody listen so now I...
Roll on 24's when I'm on your tip
They don't know who I am ain't nobody talkin' shit
Tell me when did they ever think that I was a ho
'Cause I got killas with me crips, bloods, G's and folks
And we be focused on the paper when we be up in the kitchen
When we thinkin' about the money on the steady come up and I got the niggas
That be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up
AK-47, Desert Eagle, sk, Mac 11 for the niggas that'll try to run up
Nigga what ya want I'm a bone thug get you while your sleepin'
'Cause you know I'm creepin' on ah come up

Motherfuckas actin' like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a mother-fuckin' killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murderer, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
Motherfuckas actin' like they don't know the deal
But they know just what to do
Everybody's talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
I'm a killa, a mass murderer, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of

Quit the playin' nigga and get over on the Twista I'm a see you when I see you
And I wouldn't want to be you
Got the Desert Eagle
When I'm rollin' in the Regal
And I'm lookin' at you evil
Through the eye of a needle
Not a misdemeanor
But a murder with a millimeter
Feel the heat of Twista when I'm bustin' at your whip
I get a burglar when I be comin' for your shit
I'm a get you for your goods when I run up in your crib
Tell me where your jewelry at
And where your safe
Don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face (shut up)
Is it behind that portrait or is it
In your floor (uh huh), just let me know so that I can hit it up
'Cause I gots to go
'Cause I gotta throw it so I had to lick on them niggas
'Cause it used to be that if I had to get 'em I'mma get 'em
Never ride a burgundy Lamborghini Murcielago through the city
Because I know that'll kill 'em
Averagin' a 100 yards a game
My competition better back up
I'm the e runnin' back
Niggas that ain't ready get the machete
For the lyrical Jason of rap I'mma keep comin' back

Motherfuckas actin' like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a mother-fuckin' killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murderer, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of

But they know just what to do
Everybody's talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
I'm a killa, a mass murderer, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of

The lyrical assassin the pocket I got in
I be attackin' the track
If I got a package of the good
See a legendary representa for the city
'Cause I put it down ever since I been rappin' in the hood
17 years of goin' and flowin'
And showin' these niggas when it come to beatin' me nobody could
I was spittin venom ever since the days UGK been rappin'
And talkin' about puttin' diamonds on the wood
Pullin' up in a old Cadillac before I got some thangs
And I got that guap and the number one spot now I ride a range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't makin' money off rap then we got them thangs
Got the 8 dollar hollas two for 15's
A 4 and a split a nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How I win it by makin' a 100 every summer
Pullin' up in the hummer can make a nigga so sick
How we constantly come up with hits and steady be gettin' fans
Is only because a nigga flows sick
Showin' no debate everybody know I'm great
Any muthafuckas that hate can suck my dick

Motherfuckas actin' like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a mother-fuckin' killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand

It Feels So Good,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"This goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Where playa hatin killers and the hood niggas thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home, cause one of them
Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
And slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
And we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
Cause it feels so good

It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
When niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight
Trippin off how we survivin this rugged terrain
And try to hang tight getting fucked up on game night
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the strap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin through wit black blacks
Ash trays with blunts, regs, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin the chrome out really trippin
Because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
Glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques
Now together we mush
But when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Despite the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the cuz
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
Mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
Cause it feels so good

It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze
Thinkin how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
And where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
What you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby
But can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
While rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
How later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
On billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
But the hood life was still a good life
And that we know always and forever though
For ever more rollin through the ghetto with nowhere to go
And it feels so good

It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

Alright,Category F5,2009,"On a scale of one to ten, what do you rate yourself
Here's some champagne, hydrate yourself
I know I'm lookin' good, you lookin' great yourself
I mean you shittin' on these bitches, you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My, my, my, whips is side-by-side
He just talkin', mine's outside
Do you mind if I
Take you on a test
Do you have all-wheel drive
And if that baby purr, I'm gonna baby her
Bitches gon' hate and maybe worse
Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work
I know you was on pur-pur
But this is a whole new arena
See, niggas come by talkin' bout they make it rain
I'll make that bitch Katrina
Mr. Kanye Omari, with my Entourage, no Ari
And a motorcycle jacket, no Harley
She said dude, that's cool
Gnarly

Alright alright, alright
Alright alright, alright
Alright alright, alright
Alright, alright

Twista where you at
Abracadabra, did he vanish
Hurry up and come out
But I ain't want to panic
I say that I'm in the zone
But they don't understand it
Physically I'm here but mentally I'm on another planet
And it only kinda made 'em look at me like I was stupider
Now they askin' which planet, is it Jupiter
So I let the money show cause I know stacks could talk
I'm mackin' on bitches with my intergalactic thoughts
In my Mercedes Benz
Pull up on a chick and holla at her and her lady friends
Like as rich as an Arabian
I'm kickin' pure flows
Euros they pay me in
For what I put together in the dungeon
I'm lookin' for a UK chick with a nice onion
Never beat it up like Paul Bunyan
And I can't believe they let an American Werewolf in London
Especially when drinking Gs with a tonic
Steady be trippin' while smokin' on the hydroponic
When I spit it like this they be callin' me bionic
Kanye with the Twist, nigga, how ironic
And I'm astonished haters don't wanna see me on
They wanna know how Twista get the easy dome
Swag off the chain, twenty-threes be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on
Gone


I'm blowin' on flame but yours is all white
And I'mma pull up in the Bentley all white
Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin' on some Louis and partyin' all night
Phony-ass people, I don't feel they demeanor
So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of rap's heroes, who came from zero
Makin' something out of nothing, call me Gilbert Arenas
Now I'm fuckin' with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back 'til my face be numb
I am the shit
It don't make me numb
Rockin' wit a swagger like I got an eight-feet gun
And my flow be colossal cause I spit the impossible
Whether with rhythm no limit to what I can do
See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle
And always get money no matter how illogical
I follow through because, uh

Runnin Off At Da Mouth,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992," Yo, Sinister Def
 Yo, what's up money?
 Yo, I want you to sing your funky flow style for your single. You know what I'm sayin'?
 Indeed, I think I can do that, so what's up?
 And umm... I want you to come out Tung Twisting style for me
 Yeah, I see what I can do, so umm... Tung Twista
 Yo
 Check this out

Runnin'
My lyrics are cunnin', vocabulary is stunnin', son of a gun and
I'm ranking at one, making it fun and taking my gun and loading
Exploding, causing harm, popping and dropping a bomb
Breaking it down like Imam, so be calm, 'cause see, I'm
The capable, no mistakable, making the unbreakable breakable
Able to hook 'em like cable 'cause Sinister Def ain't stable
No deceiving and weaving a web, I be leaving a stain in your brain and busting your vein
Picking and kicking a style I be licking and shaking and baking and making it rain
Simple and plain, I smoke 'em like hickory dickory dock, it's time to clock
So brothers I mop, the bigger they drop, so stop, Tung Twista, pop

Gotta be that it be lyrical hip-hop
Rocking a rhythm, I'mma stop-drop, I'm gonna give 'em a pop
Flowing this up and breaking the suckers up off of the mic and then rip it to shreds
I be kicking and making the people come off in a rage
And my lyrical magic I'm making and moving, I label this funky
Oh, this dope rhythm I throw be pump-pump-pumping 'em up in the mind
And be bringing 'em up into hypeness
This funky tempo I throw, I know that I be slapping the dope hypeness up in 'em
And then I'mma bend 'em a lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue, be leaving 'em hung among
This style I be throwing to tangle the mind of a sucker
Then label it lyricalism and scoping 'em in a prism
And giving a lyrical flow that'll fizz 'em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up, only my lyric was left
My Tung Twista is def, first, let me take a deep breath
Flowing the lyrical magic of mine I be mopping and sweeping
And breakin' 'em up and then makin' 'em break in a sweat
I be makin' 'em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kicking and popping the rhythm I'm rocking and pumping
The lyrics I put up inside 'em be making 'em rock
And a flow of the rhythm I'm bringing into the mic
I'm gonna give 'em a concept, never let a con step
To what I be giving the crowd that be making 'em hype and then leaving a con swept
Breaking the suckers up into chunks, I be leaving 'em sinking deeper than south
I'm gonna twist this up funky, T.T. be runnin' off at the mouth
(Indeed)

Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth

Listen to the tongue twist, twisting is the Tung
Because of my trickery my tongue is slippery
This style is wild I brung
Terrible, tragical, mystical, magical, wreck in a second
The ladies I'm checking and trickin'
You think that I'm sickenin', hoes be kickin' in when I stick it in
I got the enemy jumping like Jiminy like it was ten of me
Try to be friend of me, sucking my simile
If I'm ill, then give me the remedy
I'm baking like Daxon, waxin', giving 'em facts just like a lawyer
'Cause Sinister Def be runnin' off at the mouth like Latoya
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down
Come again

Here I be coming, a radical phenomenon fillimeter
Be making a magical matter be that I be
Ratatattat come flow with my tongue energy, I
Crush them, them can't overcome the power to hum
And then breaking the minimum competitor, G
Miracle metamorphosis is breaking 'em off in this
Lyrical matter becoming a rhythmous venomous pop quiz
I'm rocking this as of his and cracking 'em up with a plop fizz
Lyrical wiz, never a wannabe, gonna be ripping 'em up into particles
Then I'mma come in the pitiful puppet's mind
Seeking a rhythm and you shall find
Rocking the funk of the rhythm, me stamina cramming 'em up in a T-line
Be di-vine, me lyrical purrrrfection, a funky feline
Capping a crowd with the mic and then making 'em mangle
Pumping a fist, they tangle
Lyrics so funky even Bojangles
Leaving angels, spinnin' my tongue
And if you never coming to cheer me, I say cheerio, hero
Me rhythm will float like a boat, let's see how he flow
My freedom of speech I'mma reach up against your lyrical flowing, a styler
Jamming and dropping a rhythm and popping 'em up with the funk of a wilder
Holy sorcerer oughta come get with the funk of a slow solo
Bolo wanna throw but I show that a funky pro go, still wanna flow? Oh no
Slo-ow, oh-oh, I step when sending men deeper than south
Lyrical Sinister Def and T.T., we be G running off the mouth

Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth",https://genius.com/Twista-runnin-off-at-da-mouth-lyrics
Overdose,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"Shit, niggas got me higher than a motherfucker off up in here, man
Damn, the fuck y'all get this weed from
Motherfucker overdose or some shit off this shit, god damn
Check this shit out, though

Now pussy player haters say that I'm too raw with it
But y'all thinking 'cause I be talking shit
Them hoes say that nigga cold as hell
Fuck what the punks are talking 'bout
I want to get up with that big baller bitch
Plus niggas feeling what I'm on as well
Blunts got my mind in the zone
The one that's rocking fresh Pelle Pelle's
True to the shine on his bone
Somebody beating up the block on fresh rider rims
If it's me, hell, you can tell by the design on the chrome
Crying on the phone
Ho thinking I'm in love with her
'Cause she took me shopping and had me trying on cologne
So I left her on the line with the tone
Got up with this other bitch
Brought no weed 'cause she firing up her own
So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick
Off of some illy shit
Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split
And fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip
It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips
And MAC 10s, I lit the B from the back end
Straight to the chest and it got me sprung
My lungs started collapsing, shit, nigga, what's happening?
The sess got me tripping off the drums and guns, ready for action
Duck and swing or either up a thang
Try to be tougher, bang, scuff and hang
Suffer pain, left deranged then you's a bogus muh'fucker, man
Since the B struck a vein, I'm too strange
For muh'fuckers to compete with
I'm on some infra-red heat shit
With a deep clique, what I eat sleep shit
Well, if it's a freak bitch, she can suck a sweet dick
'Til she's seasick; blocking niggas out like an eclipse
When smoking them devils put your hands together
Like you know the host
'Cause ain't no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist
Leaving niggas comatose from my overdose

I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
Niggas rolling me B's just so they can hang

Can you figure out the cause and effect
Niggas coming on your set
Thugs coming out they drawers with a TEC
Victim bleeding from the neck
Shirts is getting wet, shorties yelling threats
Looking for the one who called for the deck
Now they airing out the hall in the spot
Hitting stomachs, leaving niggas pinched up
Bodies balled in a knot
Bullet holes in the wall from a Glock
Searching for the one who called in the shots
Hypes crawling for rocks
Going all in the socks of the recently deceased
From what was released
From the chrome beast to the dome piece
Visions in my mind being increased by inner beef
With some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf
I'm snapping hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief
Violate him but can't annihilate him
Picking up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep
Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him
Nerves still jumping 'cause adrenaline pumping is a motherfucker
Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers
Murdered by bud-lovers, making sure every one of you ho studs suck us
And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two Glocks
You would still die or you'll get too hot
'Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop
Hypes is tricking on you
Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks
'Cause when my tool click you'll pop
Can't this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous
Making musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazareth
Yet disastrous, smoking on halves and hash, fuck if it's cancerous
Bust ass simply because I mastered this
It's hard to breathe, I'm busting like an A-Bomb
'Cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve
It's hard to stay calm thinking about the bitches that I'm finna bone
Hitting my enemies and competition up with lethal blows
That's damaging, flows that's callous and we're leaving
Thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panicking
I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handling
Now it's possible motherfuckers could start vanishing
Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty and stinking from stress
And flowing over notes; them studs thinking they can get close
I know I got you tripping off the shit
A nigga said off a overdose

I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
And snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing
Kill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees
Niggas rolling me B's just so they can hang

C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties
That's full of bitches where they let me rub titties
Be able to pack a snub with me in case we get in some static
And gotta start leaking blood from stud skinnies
So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason
I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw
It can't be nickel or soft the way it's choking me
Potency'll have me rocking mics
And giving your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hooking the law
You're looking in awe, took what you saw
Got the B's, pen and pad out the bottom drawer
Then got to biting and formulating some shit you called your own
But take it to the rehab 'cause you got a flaw
To put it simple you ain't cold enough
Tripping out like you can't control the stuff
Lacking rhythm like you known to bust
In a different zone from us
You niggas need to sit the fuck down
Get a swisher and roll this up
If you think I'm speaking too bold, what's up
I ain't even on no ho shit, plus the mob is so thick
I'm the type of nigga you shouldn't want to get up close to
And take a smoke with
If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick
I be tweaking with speaking, releasing energy to show I know the ropes
'Cause when it comes to this rap shit
Niggas will choke 'til I'm ghost
While I breath reefer smoke from my overdose
Try to put me to the test, give me some Buddha bless
I'll show you who the best
Release the vocal trilogy
Alright, T, god damn slow it up, man
Motherfuckers' done felt you, man, we can go to the next shit
God damn, man, you stopping motherfuckers and shit
Man, I'm trying to get my zone on
Let niggas hear what the fuck I'm doing man
I mean, you done zoned man, let's go to the next cut baby
Man, fuck that shit",https://genius.com/Twista-overdose-lyrics

I want you to hold me, while I'm kissin' all over ya body slowly
Give it to you like a O.G, in and out

Up, down, show me how you work them jaws
And in the bed when the faucet run, you will catch that drain
That's why I love gettin' freaky with you 'cause you's a nasty thang

Verse 1:
Fendi, Prada, Enny
Inter-quantum physics
Alien and I done heard about the bitches on the Earth
So I think Imma visit
Niggas coming at me acting like they hard
Yelling fuck me, fuck you, too
Dont get it twisted when I spit it scientific
Cause the niggas that's with us do shoot
New coupe
Think youre messing with a dupe, fool, fool
Dark matter aka melanin
Outer space black power, Zulu!
Yelling out like Louie, yelling out moo-boo
Yelling out like Wayne, yelling out soo-woo
Cause Imma wreck them
And Im coming from a whole other spectrum
Tryna throw me in the flames, take away my name
Kick me out the game but I aint gon' let em

I am God, look at how the way shit go

But in a parallel universe!
All up in my face
Oh, you think you something?
Atom's an almost empty space
So nigga, you aint nothing
Telling everybody thats its on, we can spray
I know that aint you
The cells in your body got their own DNA
I know that aint you...
With my adrenaline and venom I can turn 'em into a
Minimal amount of matter when in murder mode
Screwface, I am the Omnipotent of verbal evolution
Coming with some shit youve never heard before
Like genes, chromosomes, theories of existence
Ain't no tellin' where I take ya
Bio photons turning on codons
Activating divine nature!

Yellow Light,Category F5,2009,"Sometimes I go fast, somtimes I just stop
Sometimes I take it slow, when I let the sex drop
But most of the time I go quick, when I'm hittin that shit
And she like it, she like it
But tonight she said she didn't want to go too fast
And tonight she said she want me to take my time
So I took her down and said ""Do you like that?"", and she said ""Hell yeah""
Then hit it medium from the back, I said ""It's cool?"" and she said ""Hell yeah""
She said ""Ooh baby, just take control baby
Long as you take it slow baby, then you can hit it all night baby""
She gave me the green, so I had to go, start screaming my name when I went low
And every time I started going real fast, she looked at me and said

Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light

I told her that I wanted to beat it up fast, so lil mama let me know when to go
Tonight she don't want a drill session, she wanna feel it so she told me to take it slow
I'm so used to mackin it pokin it back to back when I'm attackin it I wanna go get in
She blew the whistle like ""beep"" be still, hold it in now roll it in
She lifted her palms to hold my face because she want me to control my pace
She said she wanna feel it all, slide through the windows of the wall cause the feeling was too cold away
Well I can break it down to 50, down to 40, down to 30
In the speed you want me to, I can do for you, shawty tell me how you want it
Do you want the lambo? I give it to you like uh uh uh uh uh when I do it baby
Or do you want the 64? I give it to you like uh uh when I do it baby
Now I was thinkin I was all up in it right, but now she got me caught up at the light, I try to call it like
Green, uh uh too fast, red uh uh, too slow, she want it in the middle so I gotta

Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light x4
Gotta slow it down
Yellow light

Now with a subtle way to soothe your soul, got her lovin the way I move the pole instead of rude and bold
I want her to see what it feel like when a playa break it down into cruise control and still rule the role
Never stuck in only one speed dick shift, in the stick shift I am not them dudes
It's not a jack rabbit, when I be tappin it I wanna slow it up and give it to her chopped and screwed
Come here shawty and let me knock them shoes, feel it sensual when I rock to the groove
Make it hot then cool, if you think you butter show her how to stutter, step, stop, then move
But I get not the order, narray canary and my flow is like a shop of horror
Scaryin berries whenever I rock with the R, Kelly in every position for power we slaughter
I'm petty like veli, I'm getting money cause I oughta
I tell the girl to slow down lil mama, cause you ain't gotta be so anxious
Going rapidly when you flex yo thighs, it's still good sex if your exercise your patience
We ain't gotta do it like we racin, cause all the time that ain't how I like it
Green, uh uh too fast, red uh uh too slow, I'm on the mid level so she gotta

Than the T, the number 1 analyst on the cannabis sativa
Go and get a pillow and a cigarillo if I know what's the killa'
I'm gonna roll one up jo'
Open the Backwood up, trippin' on me 'cuz I was sloppy
I better get fucked up though
I be smokin' four different kinds of kush
It's the best of me especially the Purple and the OG
But ya'll might call it the Granddad
Better savor it and take a pull slowly
Eye lids low, ain't no doubt about it that somebody's gon' peep me
Go 'head and ride I think Ima' chill, because I'm kinda sleepy
Me and my niggas in my crew would get into it, now we be at odds hardly
Cuz' we smokin' on the ounce of the Ganja, that Bob Marley
Me-a rock to the Reggae music whenever me-feelin' spliff workin'
Kill off any rude boy, if you take away my herb that's a Earth's sin

Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
Puffin on that dro (puffin on that dro)

Blow Kush wit' Ball and M.J.G
Smoke Haze, I used to with Sigel
Freeway put me on to the Backwoods
And Bleek introduced me to Diesel
And Snoop turned me on to the Chronic
Smokin' it I was feelin' bionic
Lookin' at me rollin' the blunt
And I'm huffin' and puffin'
I can't get enough of this stuff and I'm losin' my logic
You could smell it all on my follicles
And Ima' follow you cuz' of the 'Dro
But if it ain't I call a audible
I be gettin' nothin' but love cuz' I be smokin the bud
Juss' lookin' like us from a High Times article
Particles I be grindin' up into Hash
I put some on yo' blunt if you come up with the stash
So take it to the head as a gift from coupe
But if I share wit' a bitch Ima' be fuckin' her ass
Stay havin' sessions and my ends is plenty
So when I'm smokin' my friends is wit' me
Make 'em feel a slow breeze
Cuz' I blow trees like the Windy City
Lemme' call up the weed man
Cuz' if I hear he got new shit we on it
Me and you could hook up and go get a ounce
And I got two-fifty on it

Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
Puffin on that dro (puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)
Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)
And the puffin on that dro (and the puffin on that dro)
Kush weed gets me higher (kush weed gets me higher)
And the diesel get me blowed (and the diesel get me blowed)

Im extra blowed, top flo' in the double tree in the Chi-Town
Where I'm smokin' this Kush shit back to back
Got me rippin' track to track
Like Webbie say ""Where that real at?""
That one-hit and you feel that
I know I'm a dog I done smoked that Train Wreck I ain't done yet
Ima' smoke 'till I hurt my.. chest
On the East Coast they feed me mayne
Put me wit' the Diesel mayne
Got me in New York eatin' everythang
Even try the Jamaican Kush, stick to the bag
Put my whole trick on his ass
Don't like to brag but I smoke
Choke on the best of the best
I be higher than giraffe pussy when I'm up in the West
I'm talkin' tired, I'm so high
Man, I done smoked that piss cat
Smell good lemme' hit that
That's why Micheal Phelps did that

Smokin on that fire (smokin on that fire)

For the realest nigga livin' tonight
Damn keys, they goin'

Well them drinks is on us
They all can't help it

Bro, chillin' with my niggas

Death Before Dishonor,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"Always ever, all days, death bef-

Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up

It's like ""Uh, ah!""
Muthafucka can't fight the feelin', the way I'mma fuck him
Have an orgasm and before the morgue has him killed him as if a four-five bucked him
Talk about a man being scared
I done killed him, he dead in his tomb, still shakin
Hit him in his body, and his head
Now he found up in heaven, with the wound still achin'
I wonder, if his voice still breakin'
Better be 'cause I readily
Hit him with gats and styles, that's heavily
Armed and dangerous and deadly
Them ahead of me receive two holes like a letter B
Better you instead of me
Break our peace, can increase your chances
To delete your advances
If its faint, I can paint this piece on canvas
With a paint brush that a nigga can't trust
Like a god, so I can't rush, won't crush
If you ever heard about a crew that can't bust, then muthafucka it ain't us,
 
dont touch
A mic or a gun, if you ain't gonna use it, do it
Claimin your weapons and TEC
And you gonna be ejecting fluid, prove it
Cause no matter who it -
Is, K-Town and Westsidell leave a bitch sheddin tears
The young kill everyday, the old itchin to kill, cause they ain't left nigga, dead in years
Shoot him dead in his {head}
This style of flow, is a verbal Calico, make a chest ripple
They get a call from the sky, if they all dont die, better leave the rest crippled

Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up

Life is priceless, if you try to take mine, leavin muthafuckaz cold, as a crisis
With a technique as old as Isis, and mics as my control devices
Or, do I gotta get off into some nigga shit? Show the bigger dick , with a thicker clique
That'd be hazardous, if I let the trigger click,
 
you dont benefit, if a nigga get
Off on the rage, even if its just a little bit, so goon with the riddle shit
If you got something to stress, then get it off your chest, and we can take it to the middle, bitch and go on
Get it on, and I bet you that the outcome is that I'm leavin niggas outdone, cut up
Bullets hard to see a muthafucka outrun, just because he let his mouth run, shut up
And sit back if you know what's good for you, I can still overthrow you
I dont give a fuck about the fact, that the hood know you, dont make a nigga have to show you
That Imma die, before I let you make an ass of me, snap as if you took a blast at me, and cause tragedy
That was how it was, that was how it is, and that's the way it has to be,
 
(always ever, all day, death be...)

Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up

It's like ""Uh, ah!""
Sit back and let the shit I say marinate
I pull the stage curtain back like Norman Bates, performin hate
Smokin on some reefer, preparin fate
It's a constant scuffle for us
White boys with the shit, hittin licks in the hustle for us
My nigga
 lucky, made him bleed for months
If you proceed to bust, if you a different type of breed from us
So petty niggas, yall need to hush
Two straight to you brainll mean pains inflicted
Even if it ain't thangz, a joint point-blank range, til my brain is wicked
Ain't even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryna push product
And ain't servin the right kind, ain't strivin to write rhymes
But 
Imma straighten yo life-line
Through the pipeline of a vocal combustion, plus Im with killers
Jaw stealers, flow builder rushin parties, bloody body, chillers
Pretty casket fillers
'Cause these niggas here got their shit together
We campaign the 
Creator's Way
It dont gotta be on, but then again, whatever!

Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up
Always ever, all day, death before dishonor
Comin' back as long as I can still see if you got static
Fuck tryin' to steal me, shit, you gon' have to kill me
If somebody start cappin', ain't no tellin' what can happen once my emotions erupt
If shots make me duck, thats when I'mma have to fuck you up",https://genius.com/Twista-death-before-dishonor-lyrics

Come to daddy
Tell me what I've got to do to get you licking in my custom Caddy
Never want to let you get up out the ride
When I first took a look my mouth was wide
Look at titty's with them little, bitty shorts
You got on with the thighs hanging out the side
When you work it you gon' hurt these other bitches. (That's right)
Turning me on with the way you're strutting
Even though you only walking
It be still looking like you shouldn't do that shit in public
I can tell it now from what I see you're working with
You ain't even got to ask for the blunt
Booty so fat
Gap so nice you can see the ass from the front
You fitting to hurt me how you twerk that thing
You get me heated when you pop it, baby!
Fell in love when you came up in the club
With the whole bottle of Mo', don't pop it, baby!
I know you got up in a rump shaker contest
Let us see what you can do
Sip a little something while you bounce that ass

Now go and put on the bikini for the Lamborghini
Now let me see you in a thong for the big Brougham
And when you shake it for the dollar, holler when you see me
Now I don't want to see no fatty full of rigor mortis
Go ahead and jiggle it for the one with money in his hands
Go and get up off the stage with your thick ass
And come over here by the table and give me a lap dance
Bend it over, come and get this dust
Got a player thinking that we fitting to cut
Gots to hit that from the back
Shorty got a little junk in the trunk
Look at how she make one butt cheek freeze
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move
Then work both sides and clap that ass
Remember them times
When you met two shorty's and you really want the cutey
But you let her slide
Cause the other girl with her got a big old donkey booty
Now shorty think she fine
Only if she really knew the truth
I ain't gon' lie girl, twerk them thighs
I'm in love with your big badunkadunk

And uh, if you let it go jiggly jiggly
Making it wiggly baby you can never get rid of me
And uh, twerk something!
Oh yeah! Bet the booty's softer then a teddy bear
So fat I could barely stare
Girl the derriere's kind of scary there
Come and drop it for the nigga named Twista
Come and pop for me like a pistol
Got badunkadunks from my mob
And I got badunkadunks for Jazze Phizzle
Girl you deserve respect
You look so good girl I commend you!
The hottest thing on the menu
When I'm off up in the strip club I like when you
Strut that thing, floss that ass
Work it all the way down to the floor
Climb to the top, shake it upside down
Slide down the motherfucking pole
Work that crowd, give a lap dance
Shake it like it's one eighty proof
Take all the ballers up in VIP
Girl go and work your badunkadunk

Ferocious,Back to the Basics,2013,"I be the grossest nigga spitting dirt about the hood
Then they go with the flow that's ferocious
Kill 'em off with the minimal dosage
You don't wanna see the result of my ultimatum when I focus
And I got the streets on lock
Muthafuckas feast on Twist like they feast on Pac
I'm a beast and the beats don't stop
Twista and the Legendary Traxster and we so hot
Kill 'em off if we ever get into it in a minute I'mma murder 'em and put 'em in a bodybag, ain't nothing they can do about it
Dump 'em in the streets you'll never know it was Get Money that was in the controversy 'cause I off whoever knew about it
Take it up another level when I'm off of tropical and raise it up another decimal in my mentality
Physically I be from the inner city yeah the Windy City
 but I'm spiritually from another galaxy
And I be one of them niggas that never do give a fuck
What you say as long as I'mma get 'em up
Witness that I'm fly, look at the way I kick back
Quickest in the Chi, guess you can say I spit that
Devin Hester, D. Rose
Never see me at a show in cheap clothes
Take over the game no cheat code
And I'mma ball like Shaq, no free throws, I'm on...

When it be coming to this rap shit I'm top shotta
Midwest godfather, hotter than the city like Bambaataa
And I'm a damn problem, 
a speedknot mobsta
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top dollar

If you're on what I'm on come fuck with me
If you're 'bout getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me

I am the Higgs boson
Mass of the rap, lance rigs with photons
Come on write that over more gigs and role bombs
Make you have to hold your kids in your arms
Got you the remedy
We stand the test of time like I'm the statue of liberty
And I'm bringing the wrath on my enemy and I'm an immortal
When I'm in a portal full of math and chemistry
Telling you that I'mma get 'em when I see you coming with the rhetoric that let me know you wanna get annihilated
I am at the pinnacle of what I wanna be, then leave an enemy in back of me and anybody violated
Put 'em at the bottom of the barrel I'm a animal
I kill 'em with the ammunition, there gon' be no murdering me
Coming to the surface of the Earth and the purpose of work is the worth of a person per hundred million money for me
Protons, neutrons, electrons
Building blocks to a decepticon
You just met with tron, 
the upset LeBron
Kobe Wan Kenobi
Left hand and I'm a black Ginóbili
Shootin' 'em
 until they marry death in holy matrimony
Shit on muthafuckas if I ever catch 'em acting phony

When it be coming to this rap shit im top shotta
Mid-west god father, hotter in the city like bambaataa
And I'm a damn problem, 
a speedknot mobstaz
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top Dollar

If you're on what I'm on come fuck with me
If you're 'bout getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me",https://genius.com/Twista-ferocious-lyrics
Dreams,Mobstability,UnKnown,"Hey lover, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of)
Hey lover boy, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love)

Damn, I'm trippin' cause I never really felt like this
To me women used to be only fuck foxes
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss
I know it's a risk but you make me wanna come clean
I wanna make you my queen
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams
Only for your love I fiend
Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen
Like a private boat as we float down stream
Yeah I already know you done heard this before
But the way you make me feel is real
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do
Got me head over heels, so tell me what's the deal, baby
Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied
Unless you're on my side to the end of time
I can tell you think I'm lying
But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme
You stay on my mind, even in my sleep
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real


From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night
A Maybelene queen with a body too tight
Wearin' black and white in some brand new Mike's
Draped in ice, attitude nice
You the type of woman that I need in my life
To add a little spice, cook a nigga steak and rice
I can see us one day man and wife
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child
Plus a marriage worth while
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile
But baby I need you right now
In my arms caressin' me
I can see your eyes undressing me
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe
But this way's got the best of me
On everything, I can guarantee you better things
If you just get rid of ""what's his name""
And let me in your world
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game
So can a brother come through
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month
Bae, only time can reveal a dream


Baby I'll drink your bath water by the pint
Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh
I ain't sayin' I'm never lovin' em and I ain't studderin'(or maybe stuntin') but shit
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on the ninth
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true to none, but you the one
I helplessly succumb, lovin' you more than everything
But my dollars spendin and smokin' sticky up through the lungs
I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck
In the city, no hear my pretty Go
Quick to break a fifty for, put you on my video
Young and witty ho, the only fe' I feelin' pretty for
I don't know what I was frontin' on
But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone
My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader
I promise I won't hurt you baby
Don't feel the heatseaker cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall
Get you the finest things like diamond rings
Even though my mind is strange, I'm tryin' to change
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me grind the pain
No lyin, no games, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut
Cause I just sold you a dream ho, like ya girlie did to my homie
You're how I spit it  we're fuckin her up
A sucker for love, a sucker for love",https://genius.com/Twista-dreams-lyrics
Still Feels So Good,Kamikaze,2004,"This goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that player ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Hood to hood, chrome, leather, and wood
And it feels so good

One morning I
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick
Feeling fucked up, flicked out, freaked on
Thinking about my new truck with the deep dish
Meaning deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome
After a massage and a menage, we got in the shower
Let water trickle down the brack of the cack of they booty
Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom
One put on prada, one put on Ludi, I put on Gucci
Duty calls, I'm about to hit the scene and ball
But before I leave I spray on some Issey Miyaki
Take my truck up to the wash, put the sparkle back on
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miagi
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak
So I can sip some while I split one
Chronicle enter ever follicle of my body
Calming down every molecule, making sure I don't trip none
Hit one
Hop in the ride, come and kick it with me
So I can take you through the so-and-so hundred block
And show you how my people be kicking it in the windy city
I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch
While we sit on leather gripping wood
Where the hustlers got packs and the G's got stacks
And the pimps got 'Lacks, rolling through the hood
And it feels so good

And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good

Now I done seen plenty niggas flip twenty's, flip twenty one's
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours
Mega balling, new clothes
Momma got a new store, TV screens, hundred-forty spokes
And we finna roll, right off madison to the manor in a drop-top Lexus
Sipping Henny rolling reckless, feeling so motherfucking good I could roll my vehicle to Texas
And spit it like, this is for the syrup sippers
Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make the words thicker
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand
When it come to spitting rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfucking man
Get the love, when I hit the club gotta begin, it's the weekend and the DJ bumping tattoos
Track move like some southern black blues, or like the coupe that got cruise
And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be the hottest rap dude
Ride to this while you peel, yo, hood
You could go around the block or travel the whole world, when you come back it's still your hood
And it feels so good

And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good

I spit some game wit the intellect, to the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Come and take over the world with me girl, if you good I might can see if I can be your manager
Get your career on track and your life on point and I'll show you how your taxes go
Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, smocking on some fire, galactic dro
I know it's good when you smoke that fire, puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick
Cop yourself a motherfucking Bently car, cop yourself a motherfucking Bently crib
Pop that ass, throw that dick, twork that thing, bust that nut
Drop that top, turn the bass up, put you a chameleon paint on the truck
Get iced up, bumping Twista grooves as I cruise new shoes rolling smooth up in K-Town
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues, if you snooze you lose don't pay dues for the tre-pound
Take the time to kick with your home girls and feel your nuts
Keep on hating on the L, big family we gon' steady come up and imma still smoke good
And it feels so good

And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good
And it feels so good
Turning corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Choking on a B and switching lanes it's understood
I'm a baller living pimpish man, leather and wood
And it feels so good

Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some",https://genius.com/Twista-still-feels-so-good-lyrics

Yo Body,Category F5,2009,"Now when I touch on yo body babe
And when I grab on yo body babe
When I feel on yo body babe
I say ooh, oooh, oooh (Hell yeah)

Can I re-introduce myself
For the city of the Chi, West side ain't it mayne?
Put some flame to the maryjane
Down with the same thang
With main in the left lane, peep game
Put the duck in the ash tray, got on the freeway
Sprayed a lil cologne on the car seats
Then I gotta up wit big d and six freaks
They was thick as hell, you understand me?
I was sipping on Patron about to fade out
Got up wit lil ma, had the whole lick layed out
Put the gucci on the doorseat
Countin some mo gee's, the dice game damn near broke me
So I'm callin fo mo gees's and putting a pound of weed and four b's
My thumper and my door keys
Walked up like she know me I gotta keep it moving
Cause she prolly be the police
So i, got turned tough told her to meet me in the range rove
We ain't gettin money so I gotta go and change clothes
Bumped out wit the same hoes tonight we in the hotel
Cause I got it in the mainfloor
All them looking good, but I wanna hit the main fo
What you think I'm spittin game for?
Cause I talk alotta spots andale, andale, andale, cha cha

I gotta beg for yo body
Gurl I need yo body
I see you wit my body
Every time I see yo body
I say ooh ooh
If you was a car, girl you'd be a phantom
Yo ass and yo titties
Ain't no tellin if I had them what I'd do
What i'd do, what id do

I was chose in this game
To be a cold mothafucka with the fe's and the lad's
Now let the roof all down
While I'm gettin good ol' head smoking trees in the back
You see the mix with the jewels and the stacks
Dont try to pull it, I got goons wit the gats
My money long like a python
Makes yo bitch say fuck it, Imma roll wit the mack
B-low gettin all that dough, B-low gon pimp them hoes
B-low gettin all that show, and my meat gon touch the floor
Mothafucka, get on ?SPIt ROW?
Like I said you already know: P-O P-I-M-P


Gurl, you got a banging body like a Bugatti
She got work like a cooking pot (oh!)
She got legs like a potential hit (yes!)
And a frame like a working car
But who the one the women looking spectacular fo'?
Who the one that got the bump in the back of the truck?
Who the one that saw the body wit the booty of a Maserati
While I'm in the party way back in the club
You be kinda reminding me of my gee princess
So I gotta say majesty when I say that
And when I see the way the fatty looking from way back
You be kinda reminding me of a Maybach
You be the type I know I mite kiss
And if I flow it right I know I'm so righteous
And if you wanna try and get as lyrical like the twist;
You gotta flow li-li-li-li like this
So now ima go to the back
Get a cup fill it up wit the drank when I mack on a ho
Triple it up cause wen I get out I wanna cut
Cause I'm twist and Imma kick that spectacular flow
Now I spit you with the kind of glory

Whitney Houston Tribute,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What? Somebody told me Whitney Houston died
Can't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes
She was gettin' better, now it's really just blew aside
I still ain't got over Don Cornelius' suicide
So, where do I start it? Dearly departed
One of Heaven's angels for sure, who was really an artist
Lovin' the way that my mama would say she could sing and the way it was magical
Ain't nobody like you, nobody before you and nobody after you
Could ever come near it, not here in the flesh but you with us in spirit
So sad to hear it, I'm choking up while I come up with these lyrics
And though she blessed the Earth and it's time to let Heaven prosper
I still wish somebody was there to protect her, (Who?) Kevin Costner
(Who?) Clive Davis, (Who?) Bobby Brown
Her mama and her daughter, Whitney is where God be now
Such a short time, don't want it to be this way
But if she was here, she would probably say:
""If I should stay, I would only be in your way""
If you wanna say rest in peace to Whitney Houston
I had Traxter leave 16 bars open on this song..
So that you could do so with me
So get your verses ready, hop on this track with me
Pay a tribute to the late Whitney Houston",https://genius.com/Twista-whitney-houston-tribute-lyrics
Legit Ballers,Mobstability,UnKnown,"Once again, another Trax productions
Rush for the 9-8, mobsta elites
Ain't it a shame how we make ballin' look so sweet
Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit
You know what I'm sayin', you can just ball for free
Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration
And gotta face incarceration
Eh yo, Liffy Stokes, let 'em know what's happenin'

A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong
I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones
My mom didn't understand me ""Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy
From two to the head, dumped in the riverbed
I didn't to hurt you so badly,"" I was young and dumb
Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung
Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow
But now regret what I've done
Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang
I had to do my thang
When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain
All the shit's the same
My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets
To get you out your seat
Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet
And let 'em feel something deep
Deep so the realest can feel
How I felt right before I bust that steel
Rappin 'bout my life of skrill
And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill

Come on and take a little trip with a legit balla
Chi shot-callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang)
Tigers all up in the wall
(Some bitches in the back and a pocket full of scratch
Take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away)

This shit I've been tokin' is potent
Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping
Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened
Countercode with the scope in close range
I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain
No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can
Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain
But now I did finally flip my shit legit
And workin' a different angle of the game
Even though my hussle ain't changed
I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain
Singin' tapes of cain
The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train
And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot
On the paper you done gain until you drain
But I put that on the foe
I'mma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice
But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes
To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce
Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets
With my mobsta elites on the way to North Riverside Mall
Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at
Keepin' shit tight for y'all


On the bus in disgust will I able to throw rocks in my pocket
Nickel sacks in the other
For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot
But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother
Straight up hustler
What's the mental frame of mind
That nigga had to have the roll
Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets
Or with the pistol playin' for you Mr. Reaper
Forgive those, I explode like c-4 so give me 50 feet
Bustin' shots in every directions
A nigga stop a moment from getting made
I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise
And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid
If I have to I'mma send cheese from blows
Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, GD's or foes
Workin' the spot cause we need some clothes
Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows
My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl
Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall
On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall
Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a ball
Now I fin to spend stacks at the mall
Bend the blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller
Twista AKA ""The Bitch Caller"", bring your money to the mob
Just to be a pimp-shit talker


If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm

Get Me,Kamikaze,2004,"""Here I am..""
""Here I am..""
""Here I am..""
""Oooh, yeah, here I am..""
""Come and get me!"" {*echoes*}

On a rainy die day early morn', my lethal legacy was born
Ask any rapper around, 'bout the fuckin mics I left torn
But they won't give me all my peeps, and there's only one shot to get G's
Got love for my MC's at home
, but some of them still hate on me
Look how many years I done repped, hustled through the streets in the cold
It's fire but our first rap as ever, signed the contract a decade ago
Put Chi name on records in the East, put Chi name on records in the West
Put Chi name on records in the South, bitch how you gon' open your mouth?
To the motherfuckin industry, why you hate on me and my city?
Would it be an imbalance of power if y'all let Chi niggas get cheese?
Or is it us holdin us back? Think hard when you rollin your sack
Whatever the case my Chi nigga, if it's in my means I got yo' back
What the fuck's really goin on, does the magazine know we on?
Don't he know I'm already established myself as Twista Corleone?
Well I'm holdin my city down, ain't goin nowhere, here I stay
You know where I am if you hate me {""Come and get me!""}
If you want me {""Come and get me!""} Here I am


What did I do to deserve, all of this madness around me
Found me in the studio buryin myself in work and was smokin herb
Tried to kick me to the curb
To the back to the ditch to the dump to the shack but I sprint in the front
In the 'Llac with a fifth and a blunt in the back with a bitch and a pump
And I'm ready to bust at you hoes, ready to dump lames in ditches
Steady makin fakers bleed, L.B. family handle business
Comin into Twista's realm, journey with me through the pain
The hurt just might make you envision drama that could turn you insane
How much of my chaos bring tears, how many threaten my career?
How many threatenin to murder me but bitch you know where I live
Who the fuck do you think I is? Y'all ain't comin at wit no shotties
Why you think you can hurt like these years, yo all of my peeps can you sawed
Think you finna bring out my fears? Tell me why my success make you cry
And why my downfalls make you laugh, but I bet my hydro got you high
Never let hate back me down, stand firm like a man
If you want me {""Come and get me!""}
Wanna kill me? {""Come and get me!""} Here I am


We got Geo like Neo, of course we as sourcy as Morpheus
Or we as sick as sir Marcus Aurelius alias atheist
Against niggas who flow be the achiest, against the aliens
And why they hate me is maybe it's cause I'm controllin this radius
Of this world and this whole universe, don't believe let me spit you a verse
Just when you thought you was worst, I come with words that'll make you disperse
My allies know I'm too cold, my enemies know I spit fast
My Lords know I bust that thang, my gangstas know I whoop some ass
Mobsta family steady ride, L.B. family steady click
While us and other crews collide, choose your weapon take a pick
Load up, click-clack, it's on - finna bust, get back, run home
Come at me bogus, get whacked with a strap to the back of the dome
Industry niggas get gone, heard y'all be speaking big words
I show you some shit that'll blow you now slow you down like you sip syrup
The Chi-Town's sacrificial lamb, well here I stand
Firm if you hate me {""Come and get me!""}
If you want me {""Come and get me!""} Here I am",https://genius.com/Twista-get-me-lyrics
Misunderstood,Category F5,2009,"The F scale is used to describe the intensity of tornadoes or twisters, and the damage they cause
Categories F0 through F4 describe damage ranging from light to devastating
However, category F5 describes total damage
Framed homes are lifted from their foundations
And carried hundreds of miles to disintegrate
Automobiles fly through the air like missiles, trees are debunked
Reinforced concrete structures are destroyed, incredible phenomenon
And a whole lot of fucked up shit will occur, for example

Yeah... of course...
Okay, okay
It's safe to say that I walk a fine line between good and evil
This is a fine time
For me to be trying to explain what's going on inside my mind
Nigga, I don't see no, other kind of solution
To let these problems loose
Therapeutic, the music is sort of a masseuse
To massage my mental so I won't lose it
Sometimes I can't help myself, myself got a mind of its own
Buk cannot accept this Jeff
And then Jeff want Buk to die and be gone
Both supposed to be occupyin' the same time, and the same space
But no, just me goin' out of my sane mind

They don't really know how I feel
What the fuck is wrong with the muh'fucka
Twista is the nigga off of a pill
Is he off of wet? Is he off of syrup?
Something deep with Formula 44 of Benadryl?
'Cause a nigga finna kill
Misunderstood 'cause I'm passin' whatever disaster
It's not 'cause I'm blasphemous
I leave a nigga body bloody like
Passions of Christ with a mask and a knife
Go blast with the mic
If His prophecy the first shall be last
Then I am the future, you are a primitive
Morph-ism, a scorpion, these shoes are venomous
The new artillerist
And you don't really wanna start from Genesis
And you don't really wanna spark the nemesis
Get loose if it's a crucifix, I put you on it for murder boy
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

Yeah, all those that relate then you can feel my pain
Tryna walk straight away from the hatred
That I hold deep down inside, quiet
I wait, I never talk shit about a nigga biz
'Cause a nigga's his, and besides that
I ain't no fuckin' kid, you bitch
You really know it coulda done and been some shit
There could have been a minutes
That's we really could of plenty through
But all of this bitchin' cleanin' shit
Seven-hundred million in the plastic
I just consider it all as destiny
Manifestin' itself, no fin' to shit
Steppin' over holes, watching my steps
You don't know what I been through bitch

Yet I get money like I'm Pitbull, rich
Then when I hear an instrumental, I get into it
Feel a mental glitch
Then I gotta cut a motherfucker like a Ginsu bitch
After that I'm nothing be held to love
Especially if I feel with Beelzebub
Instead of the Holy Divine, I be outta my mind
And I would detail a thug

(I'm a misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why
'Cause I'm kind of like Kurt Cobain
An expert on pain, you fear it, I got lyrics
And a pistol that'll hurt your brain
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why
'Cause I'm kind of like Tyler Durden
I can fuck a nigga up as  my body with flames
And never feel the fire hurt me
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
Like I would be only black ain't walk too weak
What I do for the hood is for the good, O.G. swag nigga
Don't talk when I speak
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)
King Neal, Willy Lloyd, and Angelo Roberts
When it come to a flow, you think your man go hard
But shit, this man'll go harder
Because I'm a (misunderstood nigga)

I'm about to fuck shit up
Got me rippin' through your body like a natural disaster
Moving like a torpedo with the speed and the vengeance of a killer
If you looking for a murderer, I'm the master motherfucker
I'm about to tear shit up
With heat from a thermometer
Go get your momma to pay for the burial
I'm an astonishing, inter-planetary
Devouring everything from Earth to Andromeda, they feelin' me
'Cause I'm about to fuck shit up
Like Freddy after Jason with a fascination for a laceration
And congratulations for eradication
Because I know ain't no vaccination for decapitation
At a rapper pacing, I'm about to tear shit up
Because I take hits with that purple like I am a Viking
Call me lyrical-ution
I run with a mob of wolves like I am a lycan
Some off the top, some I am writin'
And if you ain't strapped, iron, we fightin'
Can't rock by me, runnin' through the middle of the field
With that white like I am a titan
Niggas never know what Twista be on
Low key nigga fuckin' with a bitch from the hood
I insist that I talk to the psycho psychiatrist
'Cause I'm misunderstood

Doctor I'm problematic, tryna withdraw from always lawlessly Resolvin' all of my static 'cause I know God is calling me
But not to come home yet
Basically about the own set
Of blessings from the seeds that I've sown
Some yet might not be up on yet
But any anyhow niggas tryna pin me down
With bullshit I'll try to keep it moving
Until they fuck up and I distribute the blaow!
'Cause I'm bound by law, pure Chicago crown by the bosses
On Scuva Streets my project window down town office
All I want is my music, my money, my muh'fuckin'
Shit to be viewed among the elite, not to sleep I was thuggin'
I'm just a good nigga, up to no good nigga
Suburbs to the hood I wish you fuckin' would nigga

Flowin' this style I be singin' and bringin'
It's breakin' the people and go in the mind of a teen
Be makin' em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hip-hop is becomin' complicated, never be left hung
Bringin' a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin' up from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over that'll be stung

Frum the tip of my tung (7X)

Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin' the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin', but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin' this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'mma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin'
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
Flowin' this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by
When I'mma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee
Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T
Steppin' and then I'mma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee
Rockin' and me stylin', rockin' and me stylin', wildin'
Them say me tracks be wack, I just sip them like them coco
Loco, a lyrical thing I sling and cling like Sing-Sing, merciless like Ming
Watch me come and stiff in em like a photo
Funky, funky, funky stylin', wildin'
I'mma drop in a flow that breaks and takes a lyrical wiz to wax a funky scholar
Flowin' a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung
Breakin' em up in a snap, I think that I better thank Allah


Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick I throw in a blister of a body
Breakin' em up so quick that I can even bruise hair
Rhythm will rock blocks and funky track drops
Don't wanna come in the door but when you're hearin' this
Do I hear a 'knock-knock who's there'?

Have you ever seen a dark-skinned freak
Sexy and chocolate when she dropping it, my African Queen

Where y'all can double up on me, take me to outer space
Or we can keep it ghetto and hang in the hood on the porch

And who else nigga? (Twista, wooo, ahhh!)
Uh, uh (check it out)

Sometimes I think that I got to see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I could find myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left or the right but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my ways
I still hear a fool and I track them, distract them, and whack them
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak them, attack them, and sack them
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night, so talk shit and I'm a lift them up off of they toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In a two-seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of dro
Smoking, choking, get them open, croaking
It's so potent - I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it or keep it hidden, good riddance I'm felling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
You caught the vapors and I caught the throne, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!""

Throw it up if you get high, get blow, get drunk
If you want what I'm on, come on and kick it
Let's ride, smoke dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party
Just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs, and hustlers in the party
Get money fuck hoes, get crunk

I feel it all in my body, adrenaline with the Bacaradi
Got me all filthy, ripping shit in a rage
In navy blue platinum, he by the Belly, Gucci
Timberland stepping on the petal up in the Cadillac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
Empty out buckets of blood for fucking with thugs that'll bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for my city, anybody that different with me
Got to get him for thinking it's a game
And whether you from my city or not, talk shit
I'mma kill him especially if he say my name
I've been up on him - I handle my business
And I'm a stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat piller
Murder haters that don't feel a
Niggas claiming they want to bring it, but really don't be killers
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grow to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'ma flip or drop that 2000 on yo-- 19


When balling out of control, I floss on, flame on, pimp on
A speed deamon, pedal to the metal when I'm in the zone
Hang on cause here I'm gone
In the motherfucking wind when I'm sippin on Henn'
I got cake, while you owe something
And I done came a long way from letting me hold something, to roll something
Find a victim and fill him wit venom
And put some adrenaline in him, kill him, and send him to the cemetery
With a flow full of horror like a poltergeist
He called to Christ, when he saw how many men I buried
Shit, and when it come to chiefing good
Nigga who that? do that, I got the sack open
And the herb got the flow so strong
That I might crack the track, go back to back smoking
Never coming up when the Mob's in need
Nigga you ain't untouchable when I spark the heat
Coming at you like sharks to meat
'Til blood start to leak, I can tell when a mark's heart is weak
Come fully loaded cause I'm hard to beat
Always screaming where the drink and the dro at?
You know we love that cut up
In the back of the club with purple in the bag, chronic
Twis' and Ludacris get fucked up

Pass me the..
Let me smoke my..

Fulfilling desires like a chi shot calla

Do you love when I hit it from the back too
Let me feel how you work it that one way
Come on baby girl let me see what that do

I wish that we could
Blow out the speakers

Now we pulling up out the garage
In the platinum blue Arnage
Me and you about to hit that club
To the bar so we can sip that bud
Both of us together we would be the livest
If I had to break it down how would I describe it
(Ah- ah oh!)
We the type of couple when we get up on each other
We get it cracking in the kitchen or the bedroom
It don't matter where we at we be making noise
So play the track so the base will make you head boom
Break ya off when here one leg up
And you know I like the way you put it on me
It's the east coast queen and the mid west mob boss
Shorty I'mma never leave you lonely

Lavish,The Day After,2005," + (Pharrell)
You, you, you want the lavish crib and fancy cars
You want the face, on that Rolex shinin like the stars
Don't worry mayne, you could get it mayne
(If you look in the sky and you don't see your dream)
(Man don't feel defeated, cause trust me you can build it)

Now hear the words that I flow when I spit
I know shorties that be havin dreams of goin legit
But the hustle quicker so they cop a fo' on the split
Now they got enough money where they can go get a brick
It's on - ain't nuttin gon' stop us now
Gotta look at 24's while they watch us now
Spinners rollin up the block while they pump out noise
But they always get into it with the jump out boys
And why? Take a look at all the people that got dubs
You ain't legitimate, you out here servin them rocks up
I know you want the radio and screens to pop up
But we gotta get the money and try not to get locked up
Know the difference between real and fake
Flipping work is just like flipping real estate
Open your mind, you got more than the skill to take
Cause I know


Uh, one time for my niggas on the corner
With the burners on and with the fresh yams in they tube socks
Uh, two times for my niggas with they hands in the air
Sayin a prayer cause the game left their dude shot
Yes - I know that puzzle
Niggas at each other thinkin they will bust you
The bang is the same even if it's muffled
But the moment so loud when a dead man hug you
He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin your arms
You gon' be lowered in your arms
Cryin to open the jar, and to add injury to insult
You're smokin your life away
Look at me, big car big house big jewels
All that came out my backpack
You ain't gon' do it, it ain't gon' work, you ain't gon' prove it
Even though that hurt, I just skated past that
Look - everybody got dreams about ki's
Chains full of ice with S after the V's
Horse on the hood, a grill full with the B's
Dangling your feet in Santorini breeze
Make a virtual picture, and spin around
That ain't it, well fuck it nigga we get it down
Never try to grab your ankle nigga we'll kick 'em down
Focus up, we gotta hit it now
Bruh when your cell goes clink, that's when you forfeit
All them dreams, all that divorce it
You ain't even get to see new mansion and Porsche shit
This dedicated to my man up in Norfolk, locked up

Ha ha... wait {*repeat 2X*}
My nigga open yo' mind, mind
Aren't you ready to go?
All of my fears inside, side
Let 'em blow like 'dro

Through the wisdom of a prism I see I don't wanna go to prison
I make the decision to get liver
Reminiscin as I take a listen to my nigga 'Pac
While I envision my ambitions as a rider
Listen to Pharrell spit to the track
Pull up in a burgundy Bentley with a bitch in the back
I get to the paper like a hyper get to the crack
I ain't speculatin homey I just stick to the facts, c'mon
If you wanna get the money and the status and the mob
Better ride when you roll with the crew
Take a listen for the bub hit the bud
When you hear this in the club then you know what to do
Look at the vision of a mack spittin crack on the track
Throw these stacks in the black Cadillac
Get it like Twista and Neptunes, I got your back
And know you

Ha ha... wait {*repeat 2X*}
My nigga open yo' mind, mind
Aren't you ready to go?
All of my fears inside, side
Let 'em blow like 'dro

DJ Smoke may be found in critical condition after playing this

If he broke he ain't no friend of me
Wearing fake designer, he ain't no friend of me
Money long and still stretching like a centipede
Extended clips and prayers for all my enemies

He ain't no friend of me kill that fucking nigga like my enemy

All these dinners killing me, my energy (Gang)
Catch a fuck nigga show him what he meant to me (Bang Bang)

Too much tooka pack where my life at

And the Lords come and them folks come

Hollow heavy hitter, bullets'll slip out the crack

You were saying to me you ain't got a prop or job
You're a shame to me, half nigga always in the club
You were thot to me, can't pay for VIP, parking, you broke to me

Drink,Kamikaze,2004,"I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars
Well I treat bitches like drinks
When I step in the club and by out tha bar
So let me quench my thirst wit you and a friend
Instead of the juice and gin
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in
Glass full of ass for a true muthafucka
With that that turquoise Coogi on
You remind me of a blue mutha fucka
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada
But I think Gina was hotta
Cause her skin tone was like a Pina colada
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies
So I ordered them a mi tia and hot saki
Then I got cocky
And asked them do they come to this club a lot
Well ya got a brotha hot
Hop in my bubble drop
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita one wit the karma of margarita
The other one like two shots of tequila
And they all fine I really don't know what to think
As I get bubble and choose, I try to figure out

What's my favorite drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on 
What's my favorite drink?

Know not to bring no Cosmopolitan asses
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neapolitan masta
No telling what these thick bitches would do
Reminiscent of a big old pitcher of brew
But hit cha like a slow screw
Dip in a strip a club in LA wit a bankroll
Where the weather ain't cold
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll
I met two dancers named Moet and Crystal
I was checkin they style
We had a session it was wet it was wild
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remy Red
Wit skinny legs
Both of them game to give me head
Wit a little bit Absolut Vodka fo' they homie Tasha
Tell her to come closa
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa
If I was mayor I would campaign ass
Politician wit women swimming around the champagne glass
Drunk so much I might hurl in the sink
And if you ask me why
I couldn't figure out


If you would suck my soul
I shall lick your funky emotions
Look at that big old donkey you toting
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop cup
And have a toast wit King Boo
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck
I holla Church cause its pimps in the party
Let me sip on ya body
Get a good buzz of ya like you Lemon Bacardi
Or a long Island havin' sex on the beach
Or in the Lac sunroof let back wit a tec on the seat
Got a red bone I call her strawberry Daiquiri
Bring her back fo' may
Carry packs fo' may
Had her suck off my faculty
Got a little mamma name Mimi
Who remind me of martini and Asti Spumante
How she move to my CD
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat
She help me shake up dope
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think
As I get bubbly and choose
And try to figure out


Hennessy mixed wit some of that Alize
Gimme a shot of that Remy
And a whole lot of Tanqueray
Keep it comin' wit that cognac
Pop tha Mo' lets sip on that
Naw playa put ya money back
Cause these drinks on me
Give me a bottle of that Belve
A Long island ice tea
Hook me up a martini
All these drinks on me
I want to have a sex on the beach
How about a gin and juice for me
So put away ya money G
All these drinks on me",https://genius.com/Twista-drink-lyrics
Unsolved Mystery,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers that's prepared to whoop
Leave a body bloody, red' to scoop, poppin' off lead for loot
Shot the pussy up from head to boot
Just for talkin' dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot
Police prepare to swoop to catch a nigga on the runway
But don't none stay for the white chalk
If you aired out the tip watch your lip, because hypes talk
If you wasn't seen then you might walk
Even if it ain't the time of day these niggas will find a way like locos off of NoDoz
Careful when you servin' yo blows, because those hoes got the Po-Pos posing as hobos
Take a photo but please tell the Chi Town, he freeze
They don't give a fuck if it was DT's
They be up like the sea breeze on CC's
And they handin' out these murders like free cheese
Could you pass me the B please?
I got intricate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang
Bumpin' the dough in different denominations in nations and embracing' every word, because I'm slangin' the same
If you can hang at my town up at K-Town
If you dissin' them then you dissin' me
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me, just an unsolved mystery

Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga get put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Caught him up and wasn't wearing a vest, shot up his head and chest
Put to rest, now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Now have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

In a hoopty the shorties'll design a spot
So when they get pulled over, them people wouldn't find the spot
But if you ain't got it hid, you have the floor it if you can throw it
And motherfucker it's a nine to knot
Just go back to where your thang lay
'Cause lowkey niggas they started out in the gang way
But if you wild when your aim spray
Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin' back the same day
In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip
If you get the guns and clips to keep doin' what you doin'
Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef?
Claimin' they ain't been doin' the bruh be givin it to 'em
Flamboyant niggas must be slow
If your bitch ain't get popped then it's a blessin', she a lucky ho
'Cause no matter where the fuck he go
In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo
'Cause you can't be actin' thug roof
Because of Hennessy and drug use these niggas love juice
Some don't even consider gettin' caught
'Cause when you talk up some shit
They gonna be quick and let the slugs loose
These motherfuckers heart is love boo
Especially like them niggas up at ghost town Windy City snipe
'Cause it's a city when hype for niggas wanna get witty
For comin' too pretty and be chilli filled and decipher
To pay the piper and bow to viper, twice is rough
Now is what I'm kickin' hype enough?
'Cause every time I puff and write this stuff
I kick a frenzy facin' fuck in fury, 'cause I don't like to bluff
If we ever get into it and let the static get to me
Let's squash it and make it history
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me, just an unsolved mystery

Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Call the popo the man and mess, shot up his head and chest
Put to rest, now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Now have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

Now listen they be kickin' hocus-pocus
I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus
So writing what I wrote is hopeless
If you see and base something you said then you better be ferocious
And matter fact I hope the dopest
Fore you to try to cope this is hopeless, 'cause my lethal rhymes
Is the kind that can beat you blind, and pre-design
I peep through mines like a see through lines
Check the brain and see defined
The reason I'm gunnin' I tried the runnin'
'Cause I should have let you know
I don't give a fuck who you fronted because you was blunted
West side to the Hundreds you can't step to ho
In the state of emergency urgently the ambulance will come
And then the law will come demand the gun
But bullshit is irrelevant, they need evidence
Or trippin' on elegance they be holdin' out they hands for some
If anything they'll hand 'em some
Or get with him, here come the victim
He be shot up in his pants and lungs
'Cause he actin' hard and ran his tongue
Doesn't mean another nigga he meet in the street gon' be the man to run
'Cause a prison is some shit to see
Matter of fact fuck the talkin', my lip, let me hit the B
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me, just an unsolved mystery

Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Call the popo the man and mess, shot up his head and chest
Put to rest, now the rest should be history

Smoking the blunt that's preposterous
Shoe box, a hundred in my closet
On the way to the bank to make a deposit
I get dollars and money cause I deserve it
Do what the fuck I want with it cause I earned it
Roll up one hundred dollar bill, then I burn it
Put some bud up in the bag then I serve it
Words is, comin down up out the way that I be such a professional when I purr
What I heard about rookies
They don't know what they be doing when they fuckin' with the huffers that are fuckin' with the girl scout cookies
Get the hash, light it up
If you got some bad bitches, then invite them up
I burn a blunt and if it's tires on a car we burn a rubber, give a motherfucker 
I know that weed gon' linger
Cause ain't no telling what we gon' bring you
You wanna feel it, cover the hole, and hit it in the bone
Now release your finger
Get the full effect up out the mechanism
When I hit the ism as if I was looking through a prism
Rollin' with Berner and Wiz and we get high as
I wanna get for my niggas that be looking through a prison
I don't take it for granted, so I blow
I'mma keep it with me wherever that I go
You ain't gonna tell me, I know that my eyes low
I don't give a fuck, I light up and ride slow
Everything I know burn, and my flows burn and my rings burn
And my watch burn and my truck burn
And my eyes burn and my green burn

Take break money blow it on a gold chain

Please don't stop, and see the gun smoke
When I unload, better duck low

You got twelve girls and they're all 
Pull up in that and they all looking

Whip game proper, co-caine chopper
Don't offer me reefer unless you know the flame proper
You know I'm in somethin sick when you see the Twista pop off
Fucked up off juice and Vodka and high as a helicopter
In the grape jelly Jag or peanut butter Bentley
Or ruby Hummer cause a few bitches is comin with me
Or break down slowly I'm stallin off in the stick shift (whoo)
Mwah! Give my rims a kiss, they got big lips
Now tear the guts out, bricks'll get served
Like ostrich interior, because I'm sittin on the biggest birds
Vocalistic cataclysms, I spit the biggest words
Fuck you and yo' bitch-ass crew, I spit the sickest verbs
Yo' life is secondary, I fuck my secretary
My life is legendary, keep a gun in every Chevy

Do you want me to speed it up? (Twista)

You ain't never heard a slow jam like this
You ain't never had a remix like this
You ain't never been freaky like this
Rollin' on 24's like this
Never had a pool party like this
Never sipped on Cris' much as this
Never been to an island like this
Make one wish, and I'll give you all this

Girl you remind me of my Jeep and my S5
First I was on top of you, now you sayin', ""Let's ride""
Freakin' your body so good, I give you wet thighs
When we get together, you know we make the sex live
Take you to paradise while massaging you down
Feelin' better than twins ménagin' you down
Make you explode and now I'm calming you down
So good that you don't want me to bother you now
Now listen here, come and kick it with the players
Ghetto majors and the thumper sprayers
And we never got no room for no haters
When we pull up on them 24 Omegas
While I'm smoking on a Garcia Vega
You by my side, we be on one when we hangin
What Earthquake say? ""It's more than a relationship""
We a corporation, let's take over the nation
Let me get up with you girl, don't be trippin' on your guy
He gon' be up when the heat come out
Cause you could rub the lamp three times
And still won't a motherfucker like me come out

Girl I'll be singing 
Thriller
While you be squeezing pillows
And we can take a shower together
Get cozy in stormy weather
And if you ever going through something
I promise to make it better
You just keep on lovin' a thug
Massage and some sex when I tell you it's time
You ain't never gotta want for nothing
As long as you down and you ready to ride
I wanna give you them butterflies
Have your head all off up in the sky

Well looky here now, come look at how the playa T drop the top
Rollin' through flickin', my music bumpin so the trunk wane
Kelly and Twista, peep how we rock the block
Platinum Ferrari, it's nothing shorty, it was chump change
Or pull up in the 7-4 to the fend (4 to the fend)
Won't you get in?
While I'm steady blowin smoke in the wind (Smoke in the wind)
Hoping to win
Now speakin' words to my head in the bed
Then after we work, then we can do it that one way
Lookin thick as a loaf of bread by the legs
And you get at shakin the way the Twista make the tongue play
And this is for the love and the ladies
The fine women that be rollin Mercedes
Getting freaky and

Darkness,The Perfect Storm,2010,"You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna bring
You don't want you don't you don't
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna bring
You don't wanna bring you don't you don't
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring you don't wanna bring
You don't wanna dark-darkness into this

Nigga got me fucked up thinking I'm a ho or
Something like I won't leave a nigga punch drunk
Run around talking all tough chump
Fuck around and end up getting stuffed up
Better believe it if a nigga threaten mine he fuck
Beat him up cause a nigga trying his luck
Heat him up while the nigga trying to duck
But when I line 'em up, I'mma be firing 'em up
Like 2 lines of dust, I'mma be too cock wit' it
Glock cock aim and ready to pop wit' it
Shots gon' ring, get ready to drop man
I ready done got aim, red dot that fitted
And if a nigga thinking that I'm kidding
I got a slug wit' ya name on it homie you can come get it
And you the nigga to blame cause you the one that did it
When nigga start shit 'Wreck the nigga that'll finish
Giving shots to the face like a dentist
I'm a menace and I'm making sure a motherfucker feel it
Soon as a nigga get into my business
Only got a couple seconds 'til his blood start spilling
Fuck y'all figured? Reckless I'm one of the coldest
Put a hole up in one of y'all bitches
Half y'all hoes, the other half snitches
Matter of fact fuck it, all of y'all get it
Leave no witness, you fucking wit' the motherfucking
Realest I be fucking wit' them killers
Them niggas on the blocks
With the Glocks steady ducking from the cops drug dealing
He be thinking that he hard, 'til I hit him
In his heart and his body fall apart like Syphilis
Cause he rolling wit' a squad but I'm rolling wit' a mob
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna be around when the reaper come
Nigga better stay up out the street when a nigga got beef
When you see me with the heat just run
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna get into it with a nigga that'll straight black out
Nigga you don't really wanna take that route
Fucking with a nigga that'll straight jap out
You don't wanna bring darkness into, darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring you don't wanna bring
You don't wanna dark darkness into this

Gon' talk that shit now
Automatic shots at the enemy while I'm screaming out ""Bitch die""
Should've wouldn't have to try to let your fists fly
Did you think that you would die while you was this high?
Did you think a street sweeper would make you look at the reaper then take a peek of the death of your soul when it got cold?
Did you think that you would ever just take a good look at the darkness out of a black hole when you got stoned?
See me hooded?
Semi-automatic for niggas thinking they hard to the fullest
I'mma put it on the on the mob, I'mma pull it
Hollow points up into the chest and watch him slob on the bullet
Or choking on the blood
Tried to get at it before me but I was quicker I cut him open with a slug, on his shoulder was the blood
A little bit of artillery out to the enemy just a token of my love
And I hope this boy a thug
See if he charges, see if he ain't a mark or see if he got the heart to do what he gotta do (to do what he gotta do)
Like he a G (like he a G)
You can forget about it
I'm off the chain like a fifth of Hennessy
Unlike the piff be when I see a  tip sweet
Let your lips speak, see the clip leak
When I flick heat, leave a motherfucker up shit's creek
Popped by one of the breeze, killed by one of the souls
Murdered by one of the folks and the vice lords
Talking shit you better be ready to fight for
Got something might get shot twice for
Me and my garage is infamous
You don't want to spark the emphasis
On the pistol I can make it pitch black in the room
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna be around when the reaper come
Nigga better stay up out the street when a nigga got beef
When you see me with the heat just run
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna get into it with a nigga that'll straight black out
Nigga you don't really wanna take that route
Fucking with a nigga that'll straight jap out
You don't wanna bring darkness into, darkness into this, darkness into this

Niggas talkin bout Twista this Twista that
All I know is Twista rap I spit nigga, fuck yall, check it out

Twis got skill Yes I kill
I get wild on they ass like Buffalo Bill
I be winnin in the game like them niggas in the south
If a nigga talkin shit Im quick to hit em in the mouth
Them lyrics thats the shit I be equipped to spit em out
And I'mma make a nigga sick cause I got venom in the mouth
Antonyms and synonyms are spinnin him out of his route
And I got bricks of money bitch and I cant fit em in the couch
Kill em with the ride paints hard with the deep dish
Kill em wit syllables quick wit 8 bars in a sequence
I am the bidness I gotta charge you to peep this
Niggas cant see me Im ray Charles or a eclipse
Stevie in the blackout
 see me with the Mac out
Twista gon get money like a GD in a crack house
When it come to flows I'mma spit em like they cold
When it come to niggas heads I'mma split em like a pole
Take away they swag and shit on they cocky style
Cuz my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao
Come solo wit my k-olo when you see my logo come take my photo when Im on promo
Niggas wanna get me they better pick a new regimen
Shit too sick B somebody better go get you medicine
Not bringin up Twista Im makin the issue relevant
Balls bigger than mine betta go get 2 elephants
I be getting grimy but you and yo click too elegant
Beat yo face up til yo jaw tissue look like a pelican
I be steady whoopin yo ass just fo the hell of it
Cant nobody fuck wit me the planet is celibate
I kick a hot flow, get it like Harpo
Brief when I rhyme teeth shine like a car show
Wit a thick bitch, go head check out my cargo
You know one gon be wit me wherever my car go
Where yo baby at where yo white Mercedes at?
I'll let u borrow the Bentley as long as you bring it back
Here, a couple stacks, you aint gotta pay me back
Me and yo boss kick it and he know where the ladies at
Whether we comin and killin and murderin cause I beat down the block
Or because Im like throw ya hands up cause its hip hop
Id rather be rappin about the streets and makin a quick pot
But its time to do something so the shorties dont get popped
Meanwhile, back to the lab I got the Desert Eagle
Come on your mothafuckin tip and kill a lot of people
Throw up on a priest, let him know aint no reverend equal
Dat I go where the fuck I want Im up in heaven evil
You aint gotta tell me, I know I spit bars sick
E-mail, anthrax, flows kick arsenic
G-up genie and throw it up, Im car sick
Cut raw dope, these niggas cut garbage
Lethargic, give a bitch hard dick
See my niggas and I say ""salute"" like a sergeant
Cant lie, Im one of the coldest artists
So I wouldnt have your bitch up in my, apartment
So I be passin out, fuck you flyers
To fakers and heaters and then fuck liars
If yo shit aint one, been one minded the swine flu H1N1 virus
Am I like Jason or am I like Michael Myers?
I am the shit I need to wear diapers
When I spit it sometimes Im all too philosophical
Blame it on the Don Julio and killer tropical
Twista got more swag than a rich sissy
But dont get prissy mothafuckas can get grilly
I'mma balla and a boss and yes Im finna get paid
Takin flames to the head like Im Nicolas Cage
I ghost ride
 the whip Im finna get laid
Any niggas dat try to get me is finna get sprayed
One day its possible dat Im finna get saved
But for now I be getting money Im finna get paid muthafucka
Fucka.. ..fucka.. .. fucka.. ..fucka",https://genius.com/Twista-3-minute-murda-lyrics
Korrupt World,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up

Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood spilling
Poppin' lip and taking over his tip is why he had to kill him
Now his bodies in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost
Somebody tricked off and the killer was caught
So now his life's his cost
You might get caught
So to make a move these motherfuckers is petrified
All the best that tried won't even slide
So just bless the rest that died
Is it a test of pride when inside
You grip a trigger but you didn't wanna pull it
Could it be a motherfucker that you notice
On the other side of the bullet
Should it matter now you figure fuck it I'mma waste him
It's just a murda for the nation
But some end up locked up, broke up
For felonies and don't nobody motherly embrace him
Now in front of me encased in a coffin is a body
With people around sad and froze
Teardrops and rain
But folks didn't really feel the pain until the casket closed
How it's drastic shows in the mother through a frown
Even though the gunner was found
'Cause it seems like yesterday when he was running around
Now he under the ground
'Cause they gonna get down in these streets
Even though you pack a piece for heat these niggas urgin' to bust
The game ain't the same so stay away from the curb
If you out there serving em' up

Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt

Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood pouring
Tragedy mess a man look in the mirror then I see this thug mourning
As these streets erases others it encase a brother
You had enough heart to waste this brother
But could you face his mother? I was faced with other
Type of problems that had held me back
Couldn't tell me jack now I'm grown in my own zone
You ain't gotta tell me that so come trail me back to a time
When a motherfucker lost his will survive
Me and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal
Even had to kill to survive

I remember when you had my back
When the relative passed and my momma cried
When the house caught flames
You collapsed in my arms when you heard that father died

I take drama in stride
Even though I had to go through a thing to get myself together
Still suffer but the worst is gone
So it's on till' the roamin' man have his shelter
But if I end up back on the streets again and I had to recieve my fate
Smoke weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes
To keep the kids straight
'Cause you did straight if your seed proceed
Long as they keep learning and keep growing up
Right now to survive in a place that's full of doubt
And about to self-destruct

Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt

Visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize
Critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land
Where the unforgettable dies
Subliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it
If he don't peep it and keep it in check soon
Womb to the tomb death is in the next room
If a nigga ain't realizin' AK's and Tech's doom
Let's assume another brother wanna laugh at you
After he just took a blast at you
You won't have it you killed him
There go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you
Tellin' you a stranger must be crazy
To step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous
'Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle
If we have two things to bust
It's cocaine to us and my brains the dust
I represent till I'm dead so why try?
Long as I leave my enemy bust, vicinity crushed
I don't really give a fuck if I die, so why lie?
My people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost
It's a plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying
With their grandmother's hand on the cross
So I take a stand when I talk, ran instead of walked
To chalk another victory
How you did the caper hid the paper
Breaking other niggas off is a mystery
With the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs
Just keep comin' up, better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets
In a ghetto of a world that's corrupt

Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt",https://genius.com/Twista-korrupt-world-lyrics
Up To Speed,The Perfect Storm,2010,"Twista been comin with fast lyrics for years
I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when it come to doin a intricate pattern
I bet you y'all can never fuck with me
Cause when it come to this music
I am a mobster, I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit
Then I am a monster, I am a beast

Never let negative energy interfere with this
I be from the Outer Limits and I devour timid
Haters that attempt to annihilate what I put together
They don't wanna do when I got the mind of a military
And they wanna question if I am a lyricist
I will murder 'em with the dialect of an apostle
I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it
Ain't no telling who Imma kill and bury
How could you fuck with a nigga willin to kill 'em all
With the ability to body a brigade of motherfuckers
That come with the ruckus to you and any anatomy
Whoever strategy you will try to initiate
Theoretically I'm deciphered as infinite
In other words I'm immortal, I came through a portal
And one day Imma go back and tell 'em how them niggas all hate on me
Cause I kept a circle and will not affiliate
Ain't an impossible, never, I go the whole yard
In the law of my continuum, my minimum
Is forever and ever, so nigga, whatever you wanna do
It don't really matter to me, lets handle it right now
What happened to going and pull a nigga ho card
Fuck all the thugging on the internet cause I'm not into that
I'm on a higher intellect and I don't wanna catch a murder
Cause I know that it's possible that you might die


Now they be telling me Twista come with the hard shit
I don't wanna disappoint 'em so I gotta get it in
And kill 'em with every syllable after syllable
Like a gorilla do when I be the metaphysical
I be knowing the way I spit it be God's gift
Cause I'm feeling so fab when I fuck a nigga up
Its an immaculate conception of something immortal
And the proportion of the destruction is biblical
Like Isaiah, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus
I be a lyrical prophet, I'm a disciple with a rifle
And like John the Baptist, my raps is
A revelation of the genesis of your downfall
I'm a playa, you should follow me cause I'm infamous
And my flow is off the chain
I be rapping about something holy
Then I talk about your body being cut up in pieces
Out on the premises when they found y'all
You gotta give me the status of bein' a legend
In my continuum what I be givin' 'em, be killin' 'em
And everybody feelin' him, I'm colder than December
I'm a symbol and I make 'em remember my emblem
I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven
Committed a verbal murder, we heard the surgery
Wasn't a success when you was in the hospital
So if I ever get charged, I hope that I'mma get the minimum


Now there'll be no killing off Twista cause I'm the omnipotent
But most of them niggas just hate on me cause I flow different
Like the way that I spit a verse to get in a nigga ass
Intricate patterns of intelligently spoken words
Killin' my enemy off with the dialect of Chicago and I'mma blast",https://genius.com/Twista-up-to-speed-lyrics
Nun Ah Yall Can Hang,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992,"None of y'all can hang x16

Hype! You better pipe down or a fight's found
I know you can tear the mic down - huh, sike, clown
Say I'm phony like Christmas 'cause I twist this
Diss and hiss this, I'm pissed, come and kiss this
Butt of mine, you ain't but a blind muthafucka
Duck tail, one tail, dum tail, try to run, snail
Untangle your dreadlock, I mean deadlock
I'ma rock and hope your ears get the point like Mr. Spock
Them sucka wack rappers whippersnappers think I'm new to this
I been true to this, give me somethin' to chew to this
Like bubble gum bums that think I can't hum to a slow drum
Don't think I know where I come from, dumb-dumb, umm -
I flow to rhythms of all sorts, different sports
Give me some pants with them hands, I ain't takin shorts
Tired of them tiny turds and nerds, absurd words
They think I rap too quick, 'cause at my pace they ain't heard words
But I know one thang
None of y'all can hang

None of y'all can hang x16

My style I kick, ""You're flowin' too quick""
That's what I hear from the vics
I bet I don't flow as quick as you lick chicks
Please, think I'm sweater than peas? I flick 'em like fleas
At ease, and even overseas they flip over these
Scall, I break 'em like a fall, my lead stops 'em all
I put 'em in headlocks, dreadlocks and all
I'ma scuff vics with lyrical rough tricks
Tough kicks, put 'em at the end like a suffix
You better maxwell and get smart
'Cause I'ma flow and kill 'em and let the angels play the harp
I'm sharp, Tung, I be rollin like bicycles, I slice pickles
Should I say cucumbers, newcomers, I flip 'em like nickels
And dimes, 'cause nickel-and-dime rhymes I find from blind minds
This time they all wanna diss mine
Why? Because I let the funky lyricals fly like this
Come get with the lyrical manifest that'll be flowin' and I
Rock, they still wanna diss a pro because of my quicker flow?
You suckers get played like a piccolo
And I let you know one thang
None of y'all can hang

None of y'all can hang x16

Check, hope you're ready, singers, for steady ringers
And humdingers, bum slingers cut from Freddy's fingers
Slice, nice, twice: he sliced ice and sliced mics with spice
So precise, don't sacrifice, take my advice
Jihad is on the twelves turnin' giants to elves
Puttin' twelves on the shelves, makin' 'em hate themselves
Cuts like his, you lack that
Records were tossed, and then he crossed the fader like a black cat
Holdin' the beat like a hostage
Think it's a joke? Try to poke, then suckers get smoked like a sausage
DJ Jihad be stickin' cats
Turnin' 'em sucker ducks' cuts into chicken scratch
Get the catch?
Suckers' hearts are ripped apart
For tryin' to get with the god Jihad
Punk, that wasn't smart
Yo, ain't it a damn shame?
None of y'all can hang

None of y'all can hang x16

Summer 96,Summer 96,2019,"What can I say to make you see how the fuck I be feelin'
Nobody can fuck with the villain because I'm one in a million
Really I'm better than, kill the culture or kill the competition if one of 'em willin'
With the backwood full of Biscotti, I be the truth up in the booth
And let 'em see what it can do to your body
Killin' you is hobby, I be the one that be doin' it readily
Niggas are scared of me like Illuminati
Play time is over, it's a punisher from the  days
I'm back again, you thought it was a phase
And I be flowin' in magnificent ways
Comin' off like a semi; if you ain't hit, I bet you yo ass is grazed
A Windy City chief rocker
Since the 90s I can hit the studio and make 
knocka
 fuck a drive by
And leave the rider shot up
Bullets goin' blacka blacka when I come and shoot the block up
I'm apocalyptic like the way 2Pac'd spit it
Forever like I gotta get it, I'm goin' after the riches
You lookin' at a drip so vicious
In an era where niggas on camera actin' like bitches
Shit, I'm a balla, still up in the game
Still got the Tom Brady status with the touchdowns homie
Look at how I'm livin', everything is vintage
Diamonds all up in it, and I rock a 
bust
-down Rollie
Full of fetti, I'm on a mission
I'm with it, come get it if you feel like you got a position for the bag
I'm articulate like a mathematician
And I got the arithmetic of a money magician
But I do it for the love
Still holdin' my own, I need nobody to buy me shit
It's a Twista, I'm comin' with that grimy shit
Let's take it back to the summer of '96",https://genius.com/Twista-summer-96-lyrics
Back to the Basics,The Perfect Storm,2010,"I'm about to take everybody back to the basics
I'm historical, an oracle and event is about to occur
Because a motherfucker put these raps in the matrix
And I'm a terror when I spit it on tracks full of hatred
But there's beauty in the dark, just put it in your mouth
And the flow is, mmmmm... like that when you taste it
Coming niggas like a disciple of death
You would think I'm popping a rifle or TEC
I'm aiming right for the neck
Your mama might as well call up the funeral home
So she can write them a check, a violent dialect
That's why they feelin' me, a trilogy
A horror is what I become so they call me Jason Vorhees
Oops, I mean Jason More-Cheese
Niggas gotta pay some more fees
Hot enough to break a thermometer from another planet
I kill 'em from here to Andromeda
A comet'll hit the planet when I'm in the middle of rapping
Swallow you, a diabolical astonisher
Astronomer because I'm out in the galaxy
Challenge me, I will disintegrate your body like a particle
Follow you into a corridor at four in the morning
So I can horrify you right before I slaughter you
My boys saying they don't think I'm coming with it
So you know a nigga gotta get 'em all
Then I'mma be murdering them like a serial killer
Then I'mma hide them in the ceiling and the wall, fuck 'em all Niggas'll never get next to this
I rock a Rollie so I flex the wrist
I'mma blow up and sit in your place
Then throw up shit in your face like the Exorcist
You can't mess with this

Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow coming with that new shit
Talk about the way there ain't no morals or respect
In the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more
Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow coming with that new shit
Talk about the way there ain't no morals or respect
In the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more

Nowadays niggas acting like they loving to die (why?)
Used to be some respect
But now they just kill 'em and stack 'em
'Cause Benjamin Franklin the governor now
Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody around you
'Cause a nigga might fuck you
Don't need to be nothing but killers in your family
That always surround you 'cause a nigga might touch you
Since the recession it's been hard on the streets
So a nigga comin' hard on the beats
No order in the hood
I remember when niggas would get into it
They would have to take problems to chief
Now they don't give a fuck who they be shooting
Or who they be robbing or what you ride
All they really care about is who got that
And if you let one of these knuckleheaded bitches
Know you sitting on something, motherfuckers is gon' be at that
Southside Murderers
It's the Westside Killas
Up north and over east is a beast
What they release be leaving you deceased
Fuck up anybody that try to do damage
The block is the planet and shorties is too bucked
For it to be peace, so I carry a piece
But I don't want to shoot it 'cause I already want to
See some of my niggas locked up in jail home
Instead of hollerin' at 'em on a cell phone
R.I.P. cuz' my lil' brother Rel' gone
Gotta show a different way to get it instead of
Being on the attack full of hatred
Or get smacked in the face with
The reality of death if we don't get back to the basics

Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow coming with that new shit
Talk about the way there ain't no morals or respect
In the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more
Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit

Don't pause with the heat no more

One Last Time,Kamikaze,2004,"You don't want to see these murder guys
Princess cuts hurt your eyes
Got the chicks that work them thighs
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes
Leave your eyes closed
Bricks in my trunk while I ride slow
Smoke your fire dro
No repercussions
He was disgusting
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If them people come rushing
Can't say I froze
Won't open the doors
By the time they caught up
I done disposed of my outer clothes
Car in the garage
I say good god
My day was hard
Call two freaks up for the ménage à trois
Parlaying was hard
Sade was suave
When we was screwing
Sheets was ruined
If beef is brewing
I'm a put slugs deep into him
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards for hatin'
Master my patience
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin'
Passion for Satan
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holding shit down with they tough ass
We alias
They wishing they be us
Can't three-eighty us
Cause we will wreck everything within a ten block radius
When you see me better speak with love
Or leak some blood
I got connections with all type of BM, chiefs and govs
Deeply plugged who got to retire from crime
About to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it

Hit 'em in the body and the dome
Left the after party with the chrome
Come up with a milly
And as soon as everybody know that I'm gone
Gotta keep it Gangsta'
Cause I'm a hustla'
Do it like a balla'
Cause I'm a mobsta'

Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection to cop me a brick
And he sent a Czechoslovakian chick
She was acting cocky and shit
She like watching blow at the hotel
With big dreams to never stop being rich
And she wasn't too sloppy with dick
Said when she get on she gonna cop me a six
Platinum blue Sprewell shoes
Detail smooth
On some Mickey and Mallory me and my female cruise
Type of demo what's the bi-no
I Gave her two-six plus ten-four
That's twelve-five for the brick
And five-hundred for the plane and limo
Plain and simple
Call my guy told him thanks and send more
Meditating plot on my lick when I smell them frankincense blow
Do my thugdizzle
I ain't scared of this
Fly your head like Pegasus
Bloody up that necklace
Hope I'm an arrow ?
Them terrorist
Fucked up the lick when sending chicks on the plane
Put a major glitch in the game
But I'm a get me them thangs
As I come with new ways to travel watch my shorties get on them
Coming back with pounds and packages with the scorpions on them
Of course we been on them
Niggas know they two for forty and want them
I done seen truck loads with more keys than accordions on them
And you think I'm a pass up
That quick fast dust
Let me mask up
That ain't a fast truck
Get your ass stuffed


I spit words that be gangster shit
Make hustlers tip and ballers rich
Haters sick, mobsters hit
I'm the shit
You can see me visit the optometrist
Cars I flip
Unorthodox like Doctor Bonovich
Prada lick
But a nigga got whooped
Should have seen shit was funny
My own connection he got reason to gun me
I know he took the money
Even if I probably wrong
Turn down the volume
Shoot him on plastic to lay his body on
Fucking maricón
Two to the cabeza
Pinche puto
That ring on your pinky was too cold
Got pinch for two O's
And a half a brick
My staff is sick
Had him confess like a catholic
Always thought things was funny now you don't laugh at shit
Stupid bastard bitch
Never fuck with Twista, Turtle Banxx and Stokes
Coming up dro flowing slanging dope
I tried to chill
But when I see a lick to make the world mine
ON the love
I think I got to pull it",https://genius.com/Twista-one-last-time-lyrics

Gon' die nigga, gon' drop, cause ain't no room at the top
Walk in the room like I'm 'Pac, bringing you doom when I rock
Its suicide nigga, blood stains nigga, nuts hang nigga
Bust them motherfuckers from my black, mustang nigga
Yes I shot them with the pound, got them with the rounds
Hollow point to lay his motherfucking body on the ground
Now you breathing and shaking cold, hoping that god don't take your soul
With two bitch straps and a vest is just the only way to roll
Now if you don't wanna die, then I suggest you better try
Breathe hard, hold on to your life, fight nigga

They can take away your, heartbeat
Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe

Hit them with the screwed voice, I got her screaming in the club
Pull up on the sista, according to the scripture
I'mma break 'em off again, when I 
metamorph into

Shit, I'm coming with the pistol, when I gotta kill 'em up
Apocalyptic I'mma get 'em, when I hit 'em up
Fill his body up wit holes, and the terror that will follow
Will have a nigga hit the deck, when I send it up
Put the pipe to your dome, I don't give a fuck about right from wrong
I get in the club, a nigga be feeling so bold
But if a nigga talk shit, I'll go right for the chrome
Then when you come back, come and see me do it worse
I'mma shoot the vehicle up put your body in a hearse
Bring you back alive like the bullets was a curse
Making the drive or put the ride in reverse
Don't wanna die again better get up in the wind
Cuz a nigga kinda handy with the black four fin
Or I gotta hit him wit the millimeter nine or the rhyme
Either way it'll be a flat line

Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat

Looking for a Shawty with that ass that be 'gantig
Saw your girl jumping at the mall while I'm stunting
Say you don't treat her right
You don't buy her nothing
With this ice, fish gonna bite
So the bitch got in my car
It ain't been 2 minutes and she talking about fucking
Suck my pipe, please don't bite
Then we brought never tored apart

So fly when I'm pegging up in Vegas
Lucky when I'm taking from the haters
Ass fat, waist slim, Kim Kardashian fashion
I'm mashing, I'm whipping
I'mma take her wherever she wanna go
Cause I'm a motherfucking boss, loss
Cause I had you doing so soft
And know when she push a nigga back
And suck a nigga dick
And hop on the motherfucker, till it pop off, oh
Then she wipe a dick down
Put on a good movie
She's got some good booty
Her man is up duty
I told her to dance, she twerk it to Juicy
She talked to her man
Told him, how could you lose me?

Black on my gloves, black on my mask
It's a funeral, nigga, that's on the gas
Life, I'mma take it, angel of Satan

Far from a angel, more like a devil
Black SUVs, heavy metal, got my foot on the pedal

I can fill your back up with shells from this .38 special
Won't stop till I murder every rapper, I'm finna replenish

I won't hold back, I'mma blow and knock you flat on yo' ass
My lil' niggas'll blow and they ride for the cash
I'm a hitter for hitters, I sold my soul to the streets
These motherfuckers thought I sold my soul to the beast
Don't give a fuck about the murder rate, I'll help it increase
I got the realer gorilla shit embedded in me

Cause I'm corrupted, I hang with killers, gangstas, elites
I'm up in this bitch wildin' for Chiraq, what you think?
I catch him in traffic, wreck it and rock him to sleep


Fresh off the corner where niggas hustle and kick it
Politicking with gangstas and fucking with bitches
But never lock and try me, the shit'll get different
They know that I keep it on me and God as my witness
I been the business, why they think I'm holding the torch
I was only 12 or 13 when I first rapped on the porch
Battling niggas up in the park, I wasn't playing no sports
Man, I wanted the whole thing, I wasn't taking no shorts
I call up the guys, and we take a ride
If we catch you lacking, nigga, then we getting fire
Cause we tryna rock you, don't wanna see you alive
If we slide up on him, Swiss cheese him, he won't survive
I'm telling you niggas ain't ready, bitch, any nigga could get it
Money, power and pussy, yes, that's my religion
Proper preparation prevents poor performance in winning
I'm from where them niggas ain't hungry but they stay in the kitchen
I tell they mama to pray, look, bitch, I'm God
I know I sinned in the past but I beat the odds
I put in work, I did it for squad

'Cause I gotta rep my city to the death
Annihilate 'em 'til I don't see nothing left
They love it when I spit it for the bitches now I spit it for the thugs
Hat cocked to the right, hat cocked to the left
Brother it's a , it's a focus on ya chest
I spit it for the Lords, and for the Folks and for the Crips and for the Bloods
I'm like an American Dream
I roll to the Green, with the Souls and the Breeds and the Cobras and Kings and the 2-16
Millimeter bullets for the niggas that are tryna do opposite
They don't really wanna see how psycho I can get
I don't really see a motherfucker stopping this
Trying to come at us, you facin' the the apocalypse
.40 cal'll have ya screaming ""I don't wanna die""
I'm becoming nauseous with the fake thugs
So it's love to the real Gs and underbosses
To the niggas  case that gotta do it big
To get what nobody gave us, we was born into this system
So don't be mad at what you made us
Pull the pistol while I cock it and I bust it in the sky
One time for the U.S, for turning my niggas to gangstas
'Cause getting money is what they do best
 Capone
Gangstas is bosses
K-town is the motherfucking hood
The block is the company, come and step into my office
I'm an

American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just an American gangsta, U.S hustla

Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just an American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just an American gangsta

Forever see me in a 'lac
Got work but ya never see me with a pack
A motherfucker said he never seen me with a strap
And I heard a motherfucker say he don't see me up in the hood
Lil' nigga I don't see you, 'cause homie my hood is worldwide
And getting money is what we do
Make ya knee joints lock when I freak you
Hit the 3 point shot like Hedo
Türko?lu 
You killing the game like Pac, nigga we point Glocks like he do
See you
No one'll recognize that I'm the maker of the midwest
I'm like for real?
Controversy in the middle, I guess I'm like Shaquille
You can go on feel like ya feel
Leaving all the haters I would like to kill
But if you can hit me with the thangs
And lil' cheap for shit, let's strike the deal
Got the psychos in the city rolling with me
Ever ready to bust a shot at the  like duuu
I can bloody ya bodies like an animal
Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food
Ripping through your flesh so I can devour your heart
Music is my playground, but if the rapping don't get you, I hit his head with the back of the pistol until the bitch nigga lay down
Ain't no competition I had to be fucking a twig?
Whoever coming for me? Guess not
I'ma get it every time I wanna get it and I'm living proof
It's a category F5

It's the motherfuckin' Roc bitch, who hotter than us?
(Okay, okay)

Ayo..ever since a young buck, I been on the come up
Known to dish the raw, dish the law if they come up
And cheddar 'till the sun up..
If there's a ransom and the law get involved, then we never get it summed up
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me
I go to war wit' niggas 'round the corner from 'round me
You could front 'round me, but I read through that
Wit' the mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Segal mac
Niggas see shoot back, we can see to that
Hit yo front letters see through back, bring yo peoples back
And I used to grind out on my friend's spot
'til he's mom wanted my Tim-bots
Now my paint got me discounts
Or trans-quo all around the world, like I was signed to Pimp-dot
And if it's ten targets and I got ten shots
I'm tryin' to leave at least nine out of them ten shot..

I got my mind on my money, money on mind
But some say its a gift, I don't write but I rhyme
I, complete songs with just one try
Tell 'em it's no lie, I beef all my life...dogg
I never think, it's already there
I find ways to say it, so you motherfuckers hear it
And when you hear it you feel it, you know its real so
This is how I live it, how it's pictured for real...nigga
I'm shittin' for real
Diamonds against wood, underground king for real
Big crib when I lay, yeah I'm livin' for real
Trust me the guns come off the shelf whenever shit'll get real
Automatics and extended clips, that's what I'm hittin' wit'
Dummies in the black rhinoes
Yeah, they be killin' shit
Masked up kidnap shit, that's how my niggas get
Chi-town, NYC, that's how my niggas get..

Yes, just picture me rollin'
The smith and wesson'll stay goin' put a hole in yo chest
It's just, another hustle paper gettin' made and fold
Get mad, you street niggas finally made it
I swoop five, he know the ride, heavily loaded
Deliver pies like cake, they go straight through yo payment...yup!
Chump...you don't really wanna war
With the State Prop clique, if ya clique shot us, squad up
S-P game so damn tough, the 4 4 in the 5th tucked ya'll can't hang
Transporter turned rapper, get a camcorder film my life
Still acclompished, tryin' to fill they cups
The rap version of Mandela, call my bluff
We still the street dwellers, feel my pain (my pain)
I spit a verse and split a clip in the rain
A fool-proof when the full force open you up (what!)

Twista will rock you, you don't want the thug apostle to pop you
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossiles
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits
For real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches
Hit 'em in the body wit' the powerful forces, that'll end all your doubt
Make 'em clean up your house, bag up an ounce, hit the dance floor and bounce
We blessed wit' the talent, fuck wit this clique, it ain't gon' be easy
Cause you fuckin' wit' Twist if you fuck wit Chris, Bleek and Free-wheezy

Smokin reefa
Hmmm yeah

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin' up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twistin' swishers
 thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see 
I'm already bendin the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot
And that's on

The weed got 'em feelin umm hmm
On the front porch getting deeper
Ghetto love got 'em feelin, umm hmm yeah yeah

In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning B
Sippin on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin to talk up on the shoppin spree
Or a B of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass
And drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks
Bumpin ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock Y'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin to get they props
Pollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin up shops for lots comin back nots
Each and everyday of the week
The Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat
Bustin flows in the cipher getting deep
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and wanna try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store
For a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back
On the


One morning I
Woke up next to a chocolate fee and a red bone
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking 
Dougie
 plus you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop
I'm hangin by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin
Niggas who flippin new 98's is steady cruising
Bumpin up the block flossin for the chicken's thei' riches
But I ain't leavin off the front with the blunt
Set a swishers just to pull in all the thickest bitches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall talk to sweet
I go and get the B's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degreez and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hollin' the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin out ""Freeze""
Serving nickels wit E's staking cheese so nigga please

Now, now, when my boo let me break 'em off, freaky when we makin love
I can do shit to you that'll make you shake in lust
Comin through how I be stoppin off, kinky when I make you cum
How could you wanna do shit that'll make me break the trust?
Shoulda knew you were sheisty the way you lick me on my body
And actin shady when I'm out the crib, lightly
Cause somethin bogus just to fight me spite me all in my area
Plus I'm a Sagittarius, you a Pisces
For some reason we be clickin like we on business
But you be on some bullshit
Askin me where I go, what I do, how I kick it
Won't you get with it baby girl, I don't cheat on you and pull shizz
Now who don't wanna roll on, chrome with then go home with
Get you to the crib, give you some grown dick
I let you hold my pounds down, purchasin you phones and fits
How many times I told you, I ain't known shit
But you steady don't listen even though it's your friends that listen
Gotta have trust, but you won't back up on a couple I'll catch you wishin
Claimin that I'm fuckin on another bitch and
All in my privacy on no premonition, you trippin
Tell me why do you - doubt a brother, in one ear and out the other
Cause in my shirt you done found number
You steady lurkin while I was up in the shower
Dumpin all of my pants pockets, trippin cause you done found a rubber
And all I gotta say is

That's not right (that's not right)
Snoopin through my things (you snoopin baby, snoopin baby)
I don't do it to you (I don't do it, I don't do it)
You shouldn't do that to me (I don't do it to you)
That's not right (that's not right)
Snoopin through my things (snooooopin through my things)
I don't do it to you (and I sho' wouldn't do it)
You shouldn't do that to me (I ain't gon' do it to you)

I was sittin in the front just watchin videos
Readin my magazine, my Vibe magazine, yeah
I coulda sworn that I turned my damn 2-Way off
But damn I heard it ring, I think I heard it ring, yeahhh
If it's somethin that you think that's wrong got you feelin insecure
I'm grown - baby let me know, and then I'll let you know
Cause I'm the one that's footin the bills
And I'm not the wrong one, that's for real
You can get your shit and go, gooooo!

Now you don't see me all up in your dresser drawers
You don't see me goin through your Jag
You don't see me in your celli; you don't see me
Searchin through your thongs, and you don't see me though your Gucci bag
Baby you got the shabazz; sometimes you need a swift, kick up the ass
Just to to see how far a foot can go
Would you wash it and took it slow, couldn't though
Pressure cookin low, bitch I hope you find what you lookin fo'
I'm losin focus from fuckin witchu, don't get me charged
Come in from a show, my whole closet be picked apart
If anybody should be paranoid in this motherfucker it should be me
I'm the one smokin hydro by the jars
You need to leave my stuff alone, go and get some business of your own
Cause me and you ain't spendin precious time together
Baby don't touch mine, I shouldn't need a ""don't touch"" sign
I ain't explainin nothin, you can find whatever
And all I gotta say is

Now when I get up in your ooh-watcha-katcha
Move to the mm-ch-ka mm-ch-ka mm-ahh, don't lie
You peepin the details of my fax, mail and voice mail
And E-mail and why sugar, don't try
To come up with the justification for what you doin
The relationship's about to be ruined for what you persuin
Steadily tryna see who I'm screwin like I'm fuckin the nation
It's nothin but hatin that the homies be doin
Spittin rumors all up in your ear, tension in the atmosphere
Baby what's the mission here, listen here
You lookin for numbers and fist in hair
It must be here for a reason so quit before I have to make you disappear
I can do without you pokin through pockets
Prophecy's potent, whatchu peepin fo'?
I hate the way that all this time to tell what I been thinkin
Shoulda told you when I thought about it a week ago
But now I'm tellin you

Now how the fuck am I supposed to know what's going on
You knowing the truth but you steady just be holding on
You harboring feelings but you don't be telling me
When you be seeing me would it be better if we was hollering on the phone
They telling me you got a problem, if its a cancer
Maybe the Twista can cure it and solve it I got the answer
Too many guys, too many guns
Plenty muscle when I hustle
You think a nigga was taking enhancers
We need to holla' and get it resolved like gentlemen
'cuz if we don't I got thumpas' that turn niggas feminine
I'ma pursue 'em and pop one or two and they're gonna be choppin' and screwin' as if I just swallowed a bottle of Benalyn
I'ma just bend on 'em and get to dumpin' if we don't just holla' 'bout somethin'
'cuz you might be makin' a plot to come murder me
Oh your word to be, open heart surgery
Yeah you got on a white T but I'ma be turning that mothafucka' burgundy
I think it's a better way that we can handle this
So sit down and talk at the table, we gotta be adamant
Takin' a ride, and choppin' it up in the Phantom
As two niggas breakin' it down like a analyst off with the cannabis
He say, she say
A nigga was steady be hearin the bogus remarks
Thought I was gon' have to go get it when it get dark
We talked about it, shit squashed

Talk to me, that's the only way I could find out what's going on(x4)
Now how will I ever be knowing about when the struggles arrive
If you don't be open enough to let me see inside
Right on the surface of things you thinkin' that he's still alive
But since he been incarcerated his spirit has died
He's sitting off up in the county while he gon' be fighting a case
And I'm seeing the pain 'cuz I'm looking him right in his face
Never got caught off for pushin' a birdy
Now he gon' be looking at thirty for murder
Even though he ain't on the tape
Soon as he got locked up I had to go visit him early
The truest the homies and none of them niggas was worthy
He gave me my game and told me how bitches'll burn me
Damn, I wanna kill off the district attorney
The loser A.K.A. the prosecutor was a steady accuser
Of my boy as being around as the number one shooter
They sayin' that the evidence is a ruger, a steady pursuit
What it do you and makin' 'em disappear like the Bermuda, Triangle
Why dangle a weapon in front of the court that I know he won't use
Now you in deep shit
Now I just gotta go pay off my lawyer's retainer
Homie gon' have a better defense
And I know that you really ain't feeling like talking about it
You want your freedom and just to put it past you

How you gon' forget about me?
Should've bet it all on me

They wanna put a chink into Twista's armor
But I didn't even blink in that fiscal karma
I just be stuntin' on these niggas and ballin' on 'em
Tellin' 'em I'mma be forever young
Cause ain't no motherfuckin' artist alive fuckin' with me
You know it, they compare to none
I am a Dark Horse
Creatively comin' from a dark force
Closin' the unexpected turn of events as I commence to
Givin' you another definition of hardcore
Lord have mercy on the souls that competed with me
And didn't know what I was capable of
Let a nigga on the track and I attack and snatch a beat
And murder it, especially off of an eigth of the bud
Now recognizing me is an abomination
Speaking on the coldest and I'm not in the conversation
Overachiever, forever the underdog
I spit it but still omitted from every writers congregation
When I ain't on the list with the mic splitters
Every once in a while I do be quite bitter
The big 3D style about who quite iller
Dark Horse, Ray Allen, Mike Miller


I did it myself, my nigga
Didn't need your help, my nigga
Played the the cards I was dealt, my nigga
Now I got the belt, my nigga
And they screamin' out ""that's my nigga""
Did you forget about me?
Now you wanna fuck with me

Can't forget about him, cause he stuntin'
OG is how I'm now forever runnin with a pocket full of hundreds
Spit it how I get it and they want it cause I flaunt it
Because I get to the money
If I get to that honey, I'mma have 'em all hatin' on me
Screamin' out ""that nigga just don't stop""
Intricate part of my style is the way I swag on 'em
When I'm goin' so fast and still it be so hard
And when I do I know these niggas can't fuck with me
Style, it be ugly, they don't want none of me
And if we do get into it, it's gonna be
Just some shit that's in front of me
I'mma come gunnin', we conquer all obstacles
And if it's possible, I'mma get money, we
Welcome haters and challengers, fakers not down with us
Takin' our sound from us, we can get it on
If they want a rhyme from us and I...
Be takin' 'em out of the faith of a doubter
The face of a coward, who's bravery's forsaken for power and then I...
See if he learned his lesson, not to bully the lil' one
Cause he don't want it
Probably get the pistol off a molly that'll hit you
A one thatll come with a style of another phenomenal that'll be turnin' up the
Party when he diss you, it'll probably be an issue
If you think I'mma let you forget about the way
I can throw flames on 'em

Pull a Juelz and go all cocaine on 'em",https://genius.com/Twista-the-dark-horse-lyrics

Take you degrees deeper than death I get you dissed
To get you pissed, the mister split ya wrist
Thinking I bit twist now picture this
Me biting something from you, and you can't top me
Better yet stop me, or drop me, your technique is sloppy
Check my flow autopsy
Copy yet never be cleverly my shit blows up
Leaving them froze up, straight from the toes up
Rip these shows up, in my city, we run shit like president do
Turn you to residue, snatch you your revenue
Rip ""This and That"" like Dres'll a due
Vestibule, your dead bodies I feel we cut your hair short
Dissin the Chi, why dare sport
We fly more heads then airports
Thinking you hard but when I pull your card I bet ya stretch
Go fetch a Treach, I make him disappear like Etch A Sketch
Wretched nigga, keep Chi out your mouth or get your neck split
Quickly I used to wreck shit, but now punk I'm on some next shit
Check it, the crew you tried is making sure your bluer side
Face the beat down bitch nigga, fucking with Chi, suicide

Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH
I wonder why (I wonder why motherfuckers wanna die) 4x

I come deep as golpher tactics, pop them like prophylactics
With flowmatics, no statics takin, breakin' punks up I'm a pro at it
Go at it with whoever, crew never cracks, pack gats
Fuck your chains and locks, chainsaws, hatchets, butter cutters and bats
Braids and blades and machetes, petty shit you carry
Can't scare me fairy, burn your obituary at the cemetary
II to a casket, heads in bread bask', was dead when lead blast
And burn him like ashes, FUCK A GHETTO BASTARD
Huh, come with that ""hey ho"", better stay low
End up with a halo, spread blood like mayo
Looks like a TKO, say no, to Treachery, bet ya be thinking you're ganking
I do the shankin', Naughty kids always get a spankin'
So uh, go diss some more emcees instead of these
Punk your better ease, or get your head filled up with holes like cheddar cheese
Never let a breeze, slow me down kid this ain't the season
""Tung Twist' back to Chicago""? Bitch, who told you I was leaving?

Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH
I wonder why (I wonder why motherfuckers wanna die) 4x

Selector, my DJ cuts up, B-hyper, what's up
Let's beat the nuts up, eat the ducks up
Then sweep they guts up
The things I bring will make you spring forward and later fall back
Talking about Twisting don't impress you, like your shit is all that
Go get your tecs I got grenadas to pack pins
Be quick to stack men, black men with mac 10s
Ready to let their finger back bend
And if I catch your dreamin, of descendant schemin'
Y'all find an intoxicated demon, sucking semen, hear what I'm screamin?
Huh, another pussy wants to break me in a homosapian
Beat him down and won't give a fuck what type of shape he in
Yellow is the color of cape he in, punk your style'll be
Facing fatality, split his head like a personality
While I'll be cracking heads like jokes, leave a tight stitch
For dissing me hype pitch, fuck you and that white bitch
I'm hoping your mic switch
Remember that show in the West?
Thought I was a wimp, man please, the pimp slam Gs
Swing on MCs like chimpanzees
Get your nose bust, bones broke, make rappers split with this shit
Talking shit about the Chi behind me back, now you get this bitch
What's up nigga, come on step, unless you just a sucker
Fucking with Chi, suicide mission motherfucker

Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH

2012,The Perfect Storm,2010,"(Intro: Tia London)
If tomorrow the world ends
In the morning the sun dont seem to shine
I will stay here forever
Standing right by your side
You know they say (they say) that its all gonna end some day
(Bridge: Tia London)
So, right before it does (right before it does)
Lets make love (lets make love)
(Hook: Tia London)
If tomorrow was 2012
The last day on Earth, 2012
The end of the world, 2012
Youll be my man and Ill be your girl
2012 
(Verse 1: Twista)
Now they be telling me that these are the last days
Are we really that close to Armageddon
If living on the planet till this point has been hell
I survived cause I am legend
What if its all about to be over
Then Im gonna say you need to be my girlfriend
Hit the blunt after curlin' it, then
Me and you can get it in like the world finna end
Its predicted by the ancient Mayan civilization
I dont want to see the world go soon
But with such a beautiful girl in the room
I want to be up in you when the world go boom
Get down with your body till its lights out
Making love till the terminator come
Global warming is having a major effect
Comfort each other but we dont know which way to run
Mother Earth is about to go through another cycle
And I know that is about to end someday (someday)
(Bridge: Tia London)
Right before it does (right before it does)
Lets make love (lets make love)
(Hook: Tia London)
Like tomorrow was 2012
The end of the world, 2012
The last day on Earth, 2012
Youll be my man and Ill be your girl
2012 
(Verse 2: Twista)
Tomorrow its all about to be over
So I only live to serve ya
The dark is about to devour the Earth
So come and ride with the Silver Surfer
Now will it all in from the element
Of ether or artificial intelligence
As long as we both have the passion
The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant
I know its all about to go
So I just sit back and blow my dro
(Right before it does)
Steady looking at the clock
Before we suffer let me make your body rock
Having sex till the big bomb drops
Or till the planet go pop
(Hook: Tia London)

Whoa... go on girl (""make you do wrong"")
I know everybody gotta feel this
Yeah you got somebody at home
But this bad motherfucker right here gon' (""make you do wrong"")

I could tell when I dropped the top
I nippled off on the block, I was gon' get into some bullshit
That's the reason why I watch for cops
And keep me two baby Glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip
Still I gotta be on a mission for paper
But later on I'mma be hangin out with everybody
Never knew I shoulda been scared of the hottie
I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party
So I pull up the club in the Coupe
Look at how them jeans huggin the boots
Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell
Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jackin bitches up
Socializin with everybody flirtin with girls but got plans to go home
'Til I felt the way you was backin up on the thang
Gettin down on the flo' I could see the top of the thong
She a (bad muh'fucker) she could bass a deuce
A fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone
Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron
And I was gone, she a (bad muh'fucker)
Take a look at them hips, and how she lickin them lips
Like she was lickin ice cream
Ballin with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene
Listenin to some Al Green might (""make you do wrong"")
 + {Lil' Kim}
That's a girl that you shouldn'ta fucked with
But she so seductive, got a nigga head gone
Now you know it ain't right, got a girl at home
But tonight she the type that'll (""make you do wrong"")
{This nigga that you shouldn'ta fucked with}
{But he so seductive, had a bitch head gone}
{Now you know it ain't right, got a man at home}
{But tonight he the type that'll} (""make you do wrong"")

I got the champagne and popped the top
And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on
I don't know what I'mma tell my dawg
When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home
Shit, he about to be rockin it
Lookin sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Undressing his body with telekenesis
Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Tryin to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
Cause I'm rollin in the Hummer and the top was off
My guy sleepin anyway and that's whassup
But I'm paranoid, drivin fast as fuck
Thinkin 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib
Here come my man in the front, askin me what (""make you do wrong"")


I don't know what you talkin 'bout
Baby whyon'tcha go on back to sleep
I was at the police station, when you hangin in the club
Wit'cha boys gettin drunk 20 deep it'll (""make you do wrong"")

If you got up with a ho
Shoulda told the bitch use another douche
If you was at the police station, shoulda smelled like heist
But you comin in smellin like puss what'll (""make you do wrong"")

Well I couldn't resist
Cause she was thick as hell and so cute
Steady comin at me, she was throwin it all on me
And I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll (""make you do wrong"")

Well I know what you talkin about
So we can do it like this
I'mma go and ride, you can do what you do
Cause I done met another brother with some bomb-ass .. it'll (""make you do wrong"")",https://genius.com/Twista-do-wrong-lyrics
6 Rings,Dark Horse,2014,"Its just me against the world and I wont lose
No I cant lose, Im a born winner
These streets made a beast out of me
Six rings on my fingers
Im a champion
Put your fives and your ones up
6 rings, Im a champion
Getting money, put your ones up
6 rings Im a champion
Now ball
Ball 
6 rings Im a champion

No worries, I been killing it since she was a shorty
Still standing on top of my glory, and this still aint the end of my story
Confetti pouring, they be all in the clothes that Im sporting
6 rings like Michael Jordan, same team no Robert Horry
Put me on the verbal court with my competitors
I'ma be fucking up all of them
Money like Steph Curry, and I dish it out to my team like Chris Paul and them (Griffin!)
So lose and you blame it on fouls and how they dont be calling them
I put in work, I got rings
You cant tell me nothing, I know I earned all of them
That winning feeling I want cause if I get the shot I bet I hit the shot
Im in my glory while pouring champagne on my body like I was Chris Bosh
They wont admit it, how many times I came back and did it
They have no choice to be killing em when I spit it
Give me a standing ovation when I visit
Final four delivery, hall of fame flow
Right up in Nirvana is where my mother fucking hangs though
But I aint finished yet, Im the exquisite vet
They be like damn Twista they aint knocked you off your pivot yet
Nope!

Its just me against the world and I wont lose
No I cant lose, Im a born winner

Put your fives and your ones up
6 rings, Im a champion
Getting money, put your ones up
6 rings Im a champion
Now ball
Ball 
6 rings Im a champion

Who the fuck is you talking to? Nigga I got six rings
Swagging, my walk like Im Jordan
I know when Im hot, fingers look like Kareem
When I pull that whip up in front of the club I be knowing they seeing it
And whoever dissing this, cause they are fisherman watching the finals and we in it
The league of the streets
Winning the game with a three on the beat
Keeping that thang in the piano seat
One shot at your brain and they flee on their feet
Dont like you when you be like Michael
They run up thinking I be slipping
Long nose, 357 by my side, call me Scottie Pippen
And Im on bullshit, call  about it, Willy said he southpaw
And I murder for the squad like an outlaw
Everything that I say coming out raw
Plenty niggas I know pulling up with a Glock and a key
Acting like they winning the game
Like they pulling up at the top of the key
But I got them accolades, and I spit that fast shit
You just an absurd sound, third round draft pick
And when I win the game, then right there is your history
Celebrate like we do in Chiraq, we gon' tear up the city

Its just me against the world and I wont lose
No I cant lose, Im a born winner
These streets made a beast out of me
Six rings on my fingers

Blood In Blood Out,Legit Ballin Vol. 1,1999,"Me and my closest roll dog
Came up in an early age on the corner servin cane
Gang bangin and everythang

Broke to the right
Blood in Blood out brothers and we swore that was for life
Servin them keys and be clocking them g's and
We got whatever you need just a come and see me
Or my mutherfucking nug bout to show this city up show love
Or catch that bug from that nine millimeter slug
I broke bread with this nigga, i bust lead with this nigga
Heard he fucking with the feds
Can't believe it, not my nigga
Selling me for the cash, was he moving too fast
Talking behing my back to them damn hood rats
I'm going crazy ain't that a bitch
You try and get bitched and your closest rodey
Turns into a snitch
Just smiling and laughing in your fucking face
Went behind your fucking back hooking you with a fucking case
Going insane and i don't know what to think
Paranoid out my mind as i take another drink
Of that hennessy motherfuckin cognac
Got me reaching for my nine
Bout to peel this niggas cap
So i waked out the house
And i headed for the corner
I seen that nigga creeped up on him
Bitch yous a goner
Up that itchy to his temple why'd you try to fuck me Rodey
Starting crying seeing me
Nigga, this ain't to New Jack City
And my name ain't no mutherfuckin Nino Brown
A tear roll down my cheek and i blew his brains on the ground
Sirens all around lights all in my face
Dick boys on the case so i headed towards the gate
Bitch freeze
Bitch please
Thats what i told them punk ass cops
All of a sudden i heard the shot
Couldn't believe i just got popped
Didn't drop, turned around, grapped my nine, then i pulled it
Started yelling just like fates Bitch i took your fucking bullet
Everything turned cold and got dark
I couldn't feel nathan but the beating of my heart
Blood in blood out
I thought that we was family
Can't believe he crossed me
Got to break him off G
Am i my brothers keeper

Jail Time,Legit Ballin Vol. 1,1999,"This is Joliet Correctional Facility, you have a collect call from inmate
Yeah, this is Tucker, to accept this call, please press three now, thank you, hello

Hey sis, let me speak to momma, who me on find besides all the drama
The system took me in but then they took me under
I suffer being another number, I wonder if I could conquer this criminal
Structure built to puncture the hearts of men, when them guards come in
The bars and the pen, I know I'm in hell and its hard to win, I stay up late
Lying in the dark for me, thinking 'bout the night the police came marching in
Its like they wouldn't stop barging in, asking momma what mob I'm in
Try strictly left us some scars within, fighting back
The lyrics of a favourite baptist, him, it's over now, can't hold a child
Mould a child, scold a child or own a child a soldier now, baby, hold your tears
Become a teacher, mould your peers, let them know its cold in here
This ain't the way to spend them older years, I'm over the fears of the world
No longer momma's pearl in here, it's all clear, them older cats school me
To the game, I'm all ears, no more rats or any cold beers
The ghetto famous disappears

They run up in my home and took you from my world, now you're gone
And I'm feeling all the pain that your going through, sometimes I lay back
In my cell crying, hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before
I guess that's what I got, my family for behind bars

I'm running out of time, momma there's, yet, where's my little brother
Let me holler at him, what's up cat, I got you covered, stay in the books
Them streets is a motherfucker, undercovers' posing as hustlers
Exposing the brothers, controlling the, struggle by any means, brutality
Got the police running like the enemy, our community need more hugs
Instead of the slugs, the guns, the drugs, got crime on, killing the love
The spirits above, drop a warning sigh, its only nineteen ninety nine
But all I think about is eighty five, them good times
Momma give us her last dime, icy cups, you drop yours, I give you mine
True love define us to divine, calling it on another's pride
But I hate to see you cry, the rain come shine, my family feel my pain inside
By the way my baby momma getting married, brought tears to my eyes
I just hope my son happy

They run up in my home and took you from my world, now you're gone
And I'm feeling all the pain that your going through, sometimes I lay back
In my cell crying, hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they made me panic before
I guess that's what I got my family for, behind bars

Ran to the phone, got a hundred guys like me
And all we have is precious minutes, to reach our people, our free
Brother, listen, be strong for momma, let her know
I never meant to cause her no drama, the pain makes my vain cry thunder
Will I recover my name and still discover how the game become us
Look how they done us, watered down our pride and drunken's, riders, G's
And hustlers, we got to guide our younger, there's better days among us
Never let the rage you under upstage the promise till tomorrow
And the C's just follow, won't feel the sorrow, for the misery we wallowing
Time swallowing, them better days in this gaze got my mind boggling
Oh, momma and hey, lady, I miss you and them ways you raised me
Them hard head things that drove you crazy
Realize your son took a lot of heart from you, it's phone check time
I'm gone, momma, I love you
 
They run up in my home and took you from my world, now you're gone
And I'm feeling all the pain that you're going through, sometimes I lay back
In my cell crying, hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before

Piece of Mind,Legit Ballin Vol. 1,1999,"I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line

Play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong damn move
I was the wrong damn dude
Gino told me do the usual leave him in critical
My brother Bruce told me that he didn't pay dues
You snooze and lose
So what I'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes
And it was all on the news
See I knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed
And it wasn't gonna be me
So what I did was popped one up in my chamber and I sent three
No women, no kids
And I'ma shine on this nigga like Mop 'N Glo
You think he stopped and load
He jumped down with the rocks and a bomb on a dope
But he didn't have to be so bold
He rushed the Mob like a blob with the Glocks and more
And even called the cops on Sko
He be shitty chi with the diamond in the watch in the coat
The medallion to match with the rope
No cars and the trucks in the cars that he ride
Lookin' like a star when he glide
I swear to God when he hear the bullet fall through the sky
He be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide
Kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind
Purple Navigator and a Benz
A new , the old niggas that he used to fuck with
Took a fall for strength of a man

I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time

(Sko get it) before I step outside and do my job for Allah
Pray to Allah, undo Allah
Anything go wrong I pray to Allah
Anything go right I give my praise to Allah
Anything in sight I'ma bless for Allah
Everything tonight I'ma test for Allah
Everything you write I'ma erase your bar
If you ridin' tonight you better hop out your car
'Cause the moon tonight is traced in five star
I feel for that, I told my sisters at the bar
Y'all be aight just keep yourself to yourself
Y'all can see aight out on the streets it's double dare
Over there it's the end of the road East 99 find my kind
Still blind to the times and the signs
On the streets niggas killin' elites
Killin' 
Killin' the chief
5 stars in the governor
Everybody gettin' covered up
Wrapped up in some bloody sheets
I came off the deep saw throw my heart
Niggas slangin' a V with the L's on his way all the time
Since I'm dyin' then I'd rather go right now
Than to be waitin' in line

I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line

I can't seem to get away from all the things in the world that bring me down
And I can't seem to get away from all the pressures
And the pain that I find myself around
But I need a little more time for me to survive
All the dirty things that I did in my life
I can walk by I can try to crawl by I can run
But I cannot hide from my piece of mind
I hit him clean in the middle of his dentures
He was getting carried away because I let him slide
A couple times he went off on an adventure
Bloody murderer only to die it the Darkside
And god I like to for killin' over some Benjamins
But it wasn't about my money it was bout his pride
He had to run to the van he was defending it
In a line of duty he died for a piece of mind
I never knew I would have to murder the motherfucker
I was the one fighting and piecing and increasing the peace
I could  hit me and my brother
We was the reason for a record that CD release
We B.I.B. to the avenue about the trigger time
You can't be alive in the hood when we dirt ride
And motherfuckers got down cause never could
Never survive with the goods that god provide
So as I bogus wack him for doing my job
Eliminate niggas that hate cause they ruining the mob
I choose got bruise when I toss that guy out in the squad
While they flossing the cars we busting and turn into God

I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time

Reminiscin' on that adrenaline; now you rememberin'
Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all
Gangbangin' like Gotti, rockin' the party
Straight up shockin' your body; doin' it kamikaze style y'all
Hook 1:
Cause it's victory or death nigga
Better stay out the way when my adrenaline pumpin
Or you can get a (click clack - blast)
Die motherfucker, Die!
Ain't no makin' me bleed cause I got family to feed
It's victory or death, nigga
Better stay out the way when my adrenaline pumpin
Or you can get a (click clack - blast)
Die motherfucker, Die!
Ain't no makin' me bleed cause I got family to feed
It's victory or death, nigga
I would rather die before I can't prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin', because it's meant to be
It's victory or death I gotta hustle till I'm gone
...rather die before I can't prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin', because it's meant to be
It's victory or death I gotta hustle till I'm gone
Verse Two:
To all the folks and the lords
The bloods and the crips in every ward, lets roll
You gotta go - for what you know
If it's retaliation get low
When you get to the calico let it float
Make these niggas know when to go
Make a motherfucker bleed - for what you need
'Cause the family gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed
Luv to the Gov's, BM's, Field Marshals, elites and the chief's
Soldiers we better take heed and realize
Signs of the time, stay by your nine
Watch out for the haters and write your rhymes
'Fore the industry is set up to fuck you so you better be on the grind
Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert
And put in work 'cause time is almost up
Twister's, hurricanes, and volcanoes erupt
So we can't stop the struggle
I'm killin' my enemy, breakin' 'em off and not givin' a fuck
And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep; when I go to the sky
Thank Him from saving me form a torturous life of hell
But while I'm here I'm straight Legit Ballin' until I die
Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears
Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha
Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears
And I'm known to put it down for my city, nigga
And when we get full of the indo
Hydroponics and chronic lock up ya doors and the window
Better go and call up your kinfolks
'Cause the riders that's down with this mob
Will murder when the wind blow, won't know what you in for
We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin' in
And the only way we can survive is if we come harder
And strive to be gods instead of men!

Warm Embrace,Mobstability,UnKnown,"It's like I got the 4-4 cocked
On the block in it two door dropped
Iron my spot is keepin but hot
The pussy-ass cop throw some murder in the lot
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies
Fuck what the reason be, I'mma start squeezin these
Them niggas ain't G's, they wanna be thugs
And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears
Brought to life momma's worst fears
Pictures of a son dyin from that hot ones flyin
Baby mama's cryin at the funeral
Cause the magnum lit him like a Black & Mild
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co
I got to tip on the low-low
Bust it there like po-po takin lives with the, oh no
It's a 4-4, mini-missle with a silencer for the whistle
My favorite pistol, cause when I let that bitch ride
I know the homicide is being carried out in official
Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact
A manic that's prepared to die in combat
Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say
I can see the fear in your face
As I reach my waist for this warm embrace

I got plenty love for the 4-4
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride
But still I bust cause I survive from your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace
All you muthafuckas better duck and hide
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace

I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives
With my customized 4-5
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys
You muthafuckas better get wise
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin to kill the elite
Cause you ain't gettin no more tries
Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it
Long as I don't hear the ho cry
Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga soul rise
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five
Make sure the nigga crossed through dies
You don't wanna throw them thangs
Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time
But Mayz ain't new to the game
I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin
Punk pretend to be your friend til they get close enough to your ends
To do you in, that shit puts me on ten
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fin
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin big shit about war
Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name
Cause I put a fuckin bullet into your closest kin
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace
Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace
Before I get disgraced, I'mma catch a case
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace


With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go
Miss Millimeter's makin a mockery of motherfuckers gots to be ruckus
When I get my clutches upon this ho
Itchin' to let the barrel blow
Like a sparrow, hollows flow, like an arrow, follow most
Spit 'em up and swallow slow
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back
Payback from flashback, some bitches know
Bust 'til I see the crow from the intro
You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasions
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked
Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal licks
Deposition die for servin' them six
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick
Cause I be working my bitch
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug
When it comes to her love, it's none above she draw mo' blood
Static under the bra cause everytime I take a hit at the bud
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the Glock
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess
Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls
If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess
Loose revolver used to be a problem solver
But the nina made me a baller
No strap could take the place of the black nine
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste
From my warm embrace

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill",https://genius.com/Twista-warm-embrace-lyrics

And naw I ain't BLACK P STONE, but when I was getting production with VILLIAN we was chillin
South side, Swole brothas, who long ass braids, who real niggas stackin millions to tha ceilin
And naw I ain't a soul, but got into it with dollar and rocked pink with jack Vo Vo
Knew all them niggas when my raps flow so slow, befo' I was ridin black benzes on black Mo Mo's
And I got plenty of friends and relatives that still be all up in tha mix
Out chere up in tha streets', well f**k this rap shit nigga, I got guns you ain't gonna do shit
I ain't gonna be frontin an fakin and actin petite all in my music... Not uh, that's too lame
When it's on it's on, I pop a nigga, when you gone you gone, you finna be wiped of the earth like a memory... What's dude name? 
And naw I ain't a killa, But I'll stank a motha f**ka while I'm hooded if he pull it
Make a nigga bite tha bullet, hit em
With tha chrome cus I got tah show it's on to tha fullest
And naw I ain't chief, But I'm a motha f**kin beast when it comes tah runnin in tha streets
Ain't been on it in a minute cus a nigga getting money when I do it's cus a nigga gotta eat
And naw I ain't SOLID but I got tha up most respect fo' a nigga if he holla it
Or if he ride unda tha six I kno he be tha shit to tha real g's, I gotta pay homage
And naw I ain't hard, but on god I'll push a niggas shit back and leave em scarred
Get tha infrared beam then go steal em N steam em, stank a nigga then go put tha car in my garage
I spit crack you gotta pardon my barrage... uh lyrics I'm throwin discardin' the facade
Tha thieves wanna be thugs tryna put on fo tha streets, some beats but got no heart up in tha mud
Quit lying you lil' metaphorically speakin mothafuckas don't want it with real niggas that's out chere
Give a desription of a hell of a gun but you don't really wanna feel it from real triggas that's out chere
(cus it's out chere)

I ain't that nigga... I jus thought I'd let chu kno... when I'm rollin with a black Fo' Fo'... I ain't that nigga

Naw I ain't a playa, but in my city all tha bitches honor me like I'm tha mayor
Devastating rhymesayer, but if you wanna make it bigger than words I gotta spray her
And naw I ain't a pimp, but peel a hoe fo' a fimp and I walk with a limp
While I be smokin on the hemp and at tha party bitches sayin look at him look at him
And naw I ain't no mark or no coward, come at me you gonna get yo lil heart devoured
We don't buckle easy tah threats we be comin after next for techs for sex, money, and power
Been doin tha Bid fo' so long everybody around us talk shit
Can't do nothin but hate off tha money we make, if we don't come up off of rappin we comin up off bricks... you lil soft Bitch!

Mobsters Anthem,Adrenaline Rush,1997,"Yeah we gonna do it like this
Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this
Speedknot Mobsters
Verse 1:
My click been strugglin' half a lifetime tryin' to get our shit on
Got no G's to sit on, even sold niggas sacks and packs to get on
But let me take you to a place where these niggas learn to better pain and stress
Look a murderer in the face, comin' up where the wild and deranged get blessed ...
1, 2, 3, and to the 44
The good, the bad, and the ugly stickin' you, fleein' through the front door
And we gotta do one more, even though debo watchin me like the lottery
We can still fulfill this West Side odyssey mobster prophecy
Well, mobbin', what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot?
Jackin' off 20 G's cuz you got more money to scoop
Liff's a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers
Constantly eyed by neighbors who do the Feds favors
It ain't no major, though, whether slangin' yay or blow;
As long as its payin' me, folk, my occupation criminal
Pullin' up on hoes as the weed smoke blows
The essence of a mobster's presence is the reason she chose
As the Regency rolls, on zeros, the pearl white Olds-
Mobile, shit, I'ma ride high til I die or get killed
Smoke like fields, forever dodgin' blue shields
With blue steel  I got foolproof escape skills
When paper chasin', leavin trails of shell casin's
Adjacent to the part of your body Where the blood's wastin'
A life taken ... 
Chicago ain't a city, its a Nation
And Solid's my foundation within the mobster organization
Chorus:
If it's dope, we shakin' it up; if its coke, we cookin' it up;
If it ain't hustlin' and we got some skunk, we gonna be smokin' it up
(Wild campaignin mobster for life, carved in gold and ice)
(Speedknots roll through Chi, too cold to die, known to get high)
Its an everyday thang for my Speedknot Mob to hang
Callin' cops for thangs, ready to squab or bang
Takin' your riches, plus we known for snatchin' your bitches;
The way Chi reign my family gotta maintain , its a mobster thang
Verse 2:
I'm a fat booty fuckin', love gettin' dick sucked and bustin'
Givin' niggas punkinheads for nothin'
While bumpin'. Handle my functions
My pistol's pumpin', got hoes jumpin', a mobster's always into somethin'
I can feel Killuminati lookin' over my shoulder
And somethin' keeps tellin' me to get mine before its over
Smokin' on plenty of buddah and still prayin' to get blessed
With forgiveness for the last time I sinned on this survival quest
From hustlin 24-7 to makin niggas get undressed
The mobster in me got me obsessed with lootchie and success
So I can care less if I gotta be lootin' or whoopin';
I'm sick of beggin' niggas for rides, Id rather be the one that's scoopin'
Cause in these last days it's day-to-day hustlin for 
Mayz;
I want fresh gear every day, fat-ass chains and 
3 blades
Trippin' on that 2-faced nigga sweatin' dick while I rock the stage
Like these bitches is just tryin' to get paid to give a nigga AIDS
Like I can use her for turnin' tricks
Or either for hittin' licks and then rap about the shit
On one of the Mobstaz greastest hits
And when we come to your town(?)then raise it
Find the skunkiest weed you can, roll it up and blaze it
Chorus (2x)
I'm gonna make it through this New World Order if I gotta be rappin' and robbin';
You can't stop the Speedknot from mobbin' and if you try, we squabbin.'
We waitin' for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up
When these Chi-Town niggas roll, cause we don't believe in goin' head up
On a sweet lick for 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs
Hit me wit' love, black gloves, red eyes, the shiftiest thugs
T-shirt over my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the .380
Got a grip that was steady, adrenaline rushin' for fetty
Wild Irish Rose and Cisco make me rock the tightest flows but tip-toe
Up with the clip slow, gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo'
Cause I ain't that scummy. What the fuck got him bummy?
Got no time for rockin', choppin' in the car stoppin' with a stack of pack money
But you trustin' me, then I'm cuffin' shit, snatch all of your luxury
Try touchin' me, actin' tough as shit, my mobstas'll bust for me
Fuckin me'll make me hate you, permanently sedate you;
When the bullet penetrate you, it's goin' straight to your facial, unless we chase you
As we escape (?) by all means necessary
The rest is secondary  goin' for mine til my flesh is buried
The test is scary  for me to survive and hope we still'll be thick
With a trilogy clique for nine-seven Mobstability shit
Chorus(2x)
Ha, I just take a pull and inhale
Thinkin about my niggas thats locked up in jail
My mind dwells on crime cells, and wipin off nine shells
Only time will tell if we gotta use it
Ain't lookin for static , but if we got into it
We gotta do it, ha, mobster anthem for life",https://genius.com/Twista-mobsters-anthem-lyrics

Check out my straps
I'm finna flex holdin' them
Picture how I bust at these niggas like Cineplex Odeon
I'm finna step over them, come see how I'm bussin'
Catchin' slugs in your heart and lungs is a deadly repercussion
I got big guns and my bullets is the achiest even though you hate me it's hard to believe like a atheist
Never to offend any Christian if you're listenin' but I be Christ-like in bright white garbs, my life is interestin'
6 points of a man than under the body decrescent
Intelligent intellect like the internet I'm omnipresent
Then when the spirit leaves the flesh that God be testin'
Wrapped in a linen cloth in the pyramids where I be restin'
Syllables catastrophic to the mind state of a sucker
Complex to a scientific heathen, complicate your mental structure
Circuitry through my lyricism, I spit cyber-Gothic
Hot wires in the cockpit, everything made with fiber optic
Fire in the rocket, takin' me up to the stars
Galactic bars got me sportin' fly cars on Mars
Intricate patterns enablin' me to get money when I be on Saturn
Ain't nobody up in the galaxy willin' to challenge me when I be rappin'
Twista so cold, flow so ridiculous he's so meticiulous
They got the vapors and none of it he had to write on the paper where he was just spittin' and kickin' it
6 bars at a time, you're thinkin' it's somethin' you like now

Won't you be my daddy (daddy)
Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on me
Verse 1 (Twista)
Now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, Mack Daddy
With a hoe up in the back seat
With the '97 pimp flow
Gotta feelin when you smokin
When I flip it to a track speed ?
Talkin about a beautiful figure
Astonishing as greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in uh..
What's that movie? nevermind
Let me enter your atmosphere
As you enter my world
And lemme touch that booty
I can't believe that your momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul
You need a modeling role
Still a playa know you got it
When you climbin from the bottom
To the top of that pole
Cause you can pop and control
Your fatty's so accurate
When I'm smackin it
It's makin me say
""What I gotta do to get with that?""
When it come to makin it rain
I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin the monkey
I can get it wet
You gone see me to ya baby
You need a better man
Here come the politics
I'ma be your weatherman
Cause everytime I'm lookin up
And I see more ass
I'ma constantly see
Rain in the forcast
This-a-way that-a-way
I'm flickin 5,000 ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration
You the champion
Here's the fetti confetti
Come on and get drunk
With the money hauler?
Chorus (Erika)
You done been good
But you can do better
I done been wet
But I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me

Verse 2 (Twista)
But when I'm not for the feminine
And everybody that percieve with the hatred
I'ma teach them a lesson
I take shots of adrenneline
Cause thats the way I recieve immunization
Against the recession
I got the muscle off my hustle and flow money
An entrepenuer with ways to get more money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Hah. It's just a little bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet another ways
Then I'ma have to beat it up but first I'ma play with you girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play with you pearl?
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin or fakin
On me baby cause I know it takes the right touch
I ain't stoppin til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited I can't hold it
I'm feelin it coming I'm bout to let off an explosion
Let it ride when I see you animatin and shakin
When I touch your body you catchin convulsions
Thats when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to
You chose me. I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you

Riding Maserati cause the force is with me like I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi
If you say that you get it you better show me
I tell 'em get the fuck back if you didn't know me
And if ever your bitch be all up on me
I'ma take her to the telly, you never gon' leave her lonely
Now she fuckin' with it heavy, forever she'll be my homie
Legendary like I'm Kobe
Smoke a backwood while she blow me
Whip the work and call it Toby
Niggas talkin' yadda-yadda-yadda
I don't give a fuck, I got a lot of dollars
Breakin' down a zip in back of my Impala
Making all the bitches holla-holla-holla
I don't give a fuck, if you ain't with the team
I got them shotta's off of that promethazine
Gettin' rich is real not just a dream
I get to the mula by whatever means

Be hyped the homie call him Ralo
Make a hit up out of fifth Hennessy and snatch a  up out the bottle
Tellin' me to slow the pace and throw the race
But I be goin' full throttle
On my dick it got a model
Turkey neck it goin' gobble-gobble-gobble
And she got them lips looking like Angela
And them legs is opening, a tarantula
Talkin' shit I be sprayin' them like a canister
If not then I'll be throwin' your body over the banister
Then later I'ma go out partyin' with your manager
Cause I'm feelin' kind of cocky
Get you killed and do it sloppy
Then get some champagne from papi
Niggas out here thinkin' that they shooters
Off a molly, I can do it off a booter

The Heat,The Perfect Storm,2010,"* Best Buy bonus track

Yeah, yeah
It's a No I.D., Legendary Traxster production
Twista

I'm a giant, into astrological science
Rapper phenomenal violence, I'm such a honorable tyrant
Verbal telekinesis is cutting fellas to pieces
Hell of a thesis, but holy, like you could tell it's from Jesus
As good as Pelican Brief is, with the force of a sorcerer
Never put fork in the pork, I'm orchestrating the orchestra
Forfeit your formula, cuz I'm forming a
Thesaurus of verses, or it's a chorus of more when I smoke a forest
Super powers like Morpheus, foresee us like the Oracle
Portable MP3 players let you play what's recordable
Legendary like Traxster, not scared to bury you rapper
I'm up for the beef, you just a vegetarian actor
Identification is gon' have to go by me
Cuz long as I got No I.D., victims ain't got no I.V
Intravenous sleep poetry, Pedialyte
I'mma give 'em, they said it was hot, so check the media hype

As long as people wait, oh, there's no escape
The heat... the heat... the heat... the heat...

I recollect the era where terror and recommendations are wrecking
The mic respecting Mecca with no hesitation
Meditation in line of giving my praises to Allah
Thoughts are taken Shahada, and throwing rocks at the Kaaba
These days is bout the dollar, all of them into balling
The Sound Scan and the cannons, you ask if it's all appalling
All the ragging, the sagging, the swagging, the selling drugs
And the thug in the tight pants, what happened to yes y'alling
Sometimes I can't help the violence when I kick random rhymes
Make you shut the fuck up like silencers or pantomimes
Write an autograph for you as if you a fan of mine
Cuz I got you tripping off of the way my grammar rhyme
Fixational, my dictation is evident, I'm benevolent
Cuz the flow is elegant, throw like an elephant
They should have told him that I flow like petroleum
And I've been cold at the podium, since break dancing on linoleum


Cooling with the hustlers, eating rum fish, guns is crisp
Can't stand fake niggas and fake bitches
Don't make me upset my stomach, them killas'll come through
The bathroom and tie up your honey
I'm all about my coins, the fly Donald Goines of rap
Fuck with fly chicken tenderloins
You know it, you blow it, you know you gotta go
You can't live it, word to the mama, that's a no
Surrounded by dons and consiglieres, don't get leary
Refrigerator might fall, don't worry
You a good naked, stay in that zone
You speaking to a rich real rap nigga, cooling on his throne
Yeah, kiss your forehead with lead
I got some Chicago niggas that do it quick fast with some bread
And my lawyer, an African prince
Slid to America with three bags of dope, a black Benz",https://genius.com/Twista-the-heat-lyrics

I'm breakin' 'em off into particles of itty-bitty matter
Hit 'em with the data but that'll mean I went through with it

All into the music and the mechanism

Inflictin' a feelin' that you gotta get when you be hearin' the way I'mma put it together

That foul shit
I'm 'bout to get so disrespectful

Let's go

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what to do (what?)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I'ma just fuck with you
I just be droppin' shit
Poppin' this and there ain't nobody stoppin' this
Let's see how 21 Savage I can get
Makin' my money come fast 'cause I'm the shit
Don't ask 'cause I can spit
Why you think I flow with locomotion like I'm smokin' on the dopest potion (why?)
Catch 'em overflossin' when I'm bossin', that's why I can poke a hole approachin' 'em
You can't play with the best
Hit 'em and keep 'em at bay with the rest
I got a million and one murder ways (what do you call it?)
Faces of death, as I play with your flesh
I get the knife and
Do it, do it, do it, do it to it
I get the gun and
Shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em
Blaze 'em then I boot 'em
Get the razor cut into your medulla
Oblongata, pop a collar, bottom dollar
I be blowin' on Buddha, Buddha, Buddha
I get money like I'm McGillicuddy
I smack 'em like silly putty
If you talk shit, your rims is ugly and your bitch is ugly
I'd rather fuck with your bitch's buddy
I be goin' on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Because you know the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
Should I do something to have everybody in love with you?
Make 'em wanna bust at you
Should I do something to have everybody go comatose?
Shit that go coast to coast
Or do I hide the people in here catching the Holy Ghost?
Spit the flow from Overdose
I stood up in the 
That you see I can spit 
But see he and 
And if he talkin' shit, I put him in his place
And if you don't admit, I say you in a wrong
And I ain't a king and I ain't on a throne
, I can say I did it on my own
But come at me wrong, I kill him on a song
Now let me try to figure 
Think I know, think I know, think I know, think I know what to do
Murder shit, I got big burners, bitch, hollow tips
I say a lot of shit, just to fuck with you
I don't just end 
Do some shit that'll gon' put an end to you
Kill everybody inside of the house
The dog and women too (but what about the kids?)
Kill the infants too
I got shit that'll make a nigga wanna beat the break up off the nigga
Rub the face up off the nigga
Lay him out of , get the shakes up off the nigga
Seen him bleed before
Or shoot out with a purpose, or see the 
And if I just happen to shoot the civilians or innocent people then fuck it
Casualties of war
I saw when you was in the party, you  my crew, 
Went to the  and your buddy, and called you ""a bitch""
Told you my flow was tailor-made
Piss you off like a fade away
Don't , I can still slit your throat like a razor blade

We gon' shoot up your mama house
And if you thinkin' that's some bogus type of shit for me to say
Then tell me what you gon' think when I say I will spit in your mama mouth

When I Get You Home (A.I.O.U.),The Day After,2005,"When I get you home (home) {*3X*}
When I get you home
When I get you home (home) {*3X*}
I'm gonna... HIT IT!

You keep on talking all that shit
Up on your two-way and your phone
Girl, but when I get you home (hit it, hit it)
You and I alone (hit it, hit it)
In the house it's (A, A), the bed it's (I, I)
Bathroom it's (O, O), in the kitchen it's (U, U)
When I get home
You and I alone... Hey!

Now come and tell me where you get that from
Now Twista be out here messin' with all the ladies
Ask me what I wanna hit that for
Cause you sexy and I'm a baller baby
Ask me why I got a nasty mouth
You the one that's steady trippin' with the sassy mouth
But when I get you up in the apartment that's when we get to sparkin'
And that's when we let the passion out
Like the way you walk in slow in the room and smelling sweet as a rose
An looking good in that red thong
Lookin' thick as hell do it to me well
Got me sprung and I know I got your head gone
Even slow or faster girl
When I'm gone how you trip is a disaster girl
When I'm steppin' to the tunes of Neptunes you wanna bring drama
And that's when I gotta ask you girl, why?


When you was 'sleep last night
After rubbing you down and making passionate love
I put on a pair of Air Force Ones
6 figures of jewellery and met my guys at the club
Pulled up out front, yeah we had to stunt
Homey was sittin' on 26s
We about to do the dummy finna blow a little money
Steady gettin' scummy with these bitches
That's about when you started to call
Then my whole mutherfuckin' high started to fall
Cause you started trippin' on me when you was in the crib 'sleep
But you don't even need to get started at all
You know I'm in the VIP lookin' at all this ass
And I finna leave I finna cut you as soon as I'm out
But you steady yada yada with the motherfuckin drama
Girl shut up what the fuck is you talkin' about?


Hey, hey, hey, hey
Girl don't you worry about me fallin' asleep, girl it's early
I kiss you up from your head to feet, don't you worry
My appetite is nothin' sweet, and nothin' could curb me
I grab you like we don't have all night, even though it's early

Trippin' on me when I go to the mall
Trippin' on me when I go to club
Trippin' on me when I kick it with my boys
You be trippin' on me when I'm on the tour bus
You don't trip when I get you gone
You don't trip when I get you chrome
You be trippin' when I'm away from you
But I bet you don't trip when I get you home

Go live or die by the cold niggas
Wit drama bringers ear ringers and pistol slingers with itchy fingers
Getting high on inhaling nigga smoke that lingers
Buck wild hostile we verbal barrels threw nostrils
My hollow point apostles turn living flesh into fossils
It's through gospel niggas will wet it vick Malif'll shred it
Beef on these streets only gets the best of you if you let it

Well it's that Westside nigga from K-Town always gonna stay down
Lay pounds on the table, smoking while watchin cable
I'm able to lick the shot from the porch of my block
And when the gun spray stops there's no information for cops
Nigga I'm heartless some say I role wit the forces of darkness
But the closest I burned to death is the reason that I spark this (Spark this what)
Dramafied premeditated homicide that coincides with the day you die
Cause G, I'm about to let it ride
2x
Petty niggas down when the bullets fly
No remorse for fuckin wit a mobsta
For fuckin wit a mobsta
If you got your shit right then run and hide
Cause I got a slip quick clip on the side
For fuckin wit a mobsta

Fuck the car jack we do a body snatch
Tie niggas up in the trunk wit them rats like a mac for owning scratch
SpeedKnot's unstoppable muderin as many niggas as possible
Makin heaven a hospital, and where I'm from it's highly probable
In a Benny reefa roller street patroller stackin clips for lethal loadin
In the city where secrecy's golden
Live or die in the Chi, we kill demeanors wit inferred beamers
Death is the sinner
Whether the Reaper awaits your fate with your soul on his finger

When the Mobstaz greet you with bullets like Robert De Niro on Heat
And makin killin look sweet
See a nigga like Mayze break the safety I hold the clip 'till infinite
To show your definite when I make you cry blood like I broke your virginity
Shit my Mobstaz is straight cheat vs. killers for cash
Quick to stick your ass and flash this 3-80 and rainbow macs
And now you thinking of bringin that bull shit in this direction
Just cause you rap a lot don't mean you can't get a lethal injection

Picture Link the mercenary fuckin you like missionary
Position them missile carriers precision 'till them bitches buried
But a mobstaz sip on Sherries snitch niggas sing like canaries
Where we wrong be carrying clone Periyon and Herringbone
We on the streets in territory we chill come and get you chest pealed
Hot steal and banana clips standing on tip you get your flesh filled wit rhinos
Energies feel for my soul they holdin captive
Visions of living strengthy posses me lets make it happen


Smokin on sweet reef for the beat freak
Cause it's in the heat seaker of the street sweeper
Think I'm lying if you want shit is deadly as slugs
Got you swimming in the blood like sea creatures
Cause you done lit to the land of the lost
Where our straps looking as pretty as bitches
But pullin up in a hearse to a church is the curse of these hideous witches
Hittin hoes wit, 44's and four by fours wit the pain of a figure four
Wounds hit you like a hit will blow
Every nigga on this track I'll pull a trigger for
If you test the rock vest, pullin slugs like a lockness
I'm a for show protect my chest
Everything in holes is what I unload and not less
Until meals make progress
Y'all niggas no who y'all be never let me see your face in my spot
While you still be facin your block I'mma be erasing your block
Snappin off like Jason on rocks tastin your knots
Cause when it's pockets for profit
I can't stop it this mob-gothic
If you ain't gonna pop it don't cock it
Cause if we working you
Rage'll have us carrying clips that's reversible
Takin all our business personal diss wit a verse we all hurtin you
Bull shit aside, (Niggas is knowin I fill another wit holes and not hide)
Better role if not ride unless you hoes don't got pride
No remorse when your fuckin wit a SpeedKnot Mobsta

Probably owin you an apology
For thinkin I'mma be better but I'm lovin the way she rockin me
Possibly I could be up in the odyssey
From how good that bottom be when I let her get on top of me
I knew that she was kinda buck when she got in the truck
I wanna hit it after sippin the 'gnac in a cup
I like the way the booty look when she backin it up
Come with me and let's get buck in the back of the bus
A good time, are you with that there?
Come and give it to me cause I gotta get that there
Nuvo is here, gon' sip that there
Then pop this here, let me hit that there (that there)

My alien complex can get as lethal as bomb threats
When I put together patterns and concepts
But when it come to dealin' with pain and problems and relationships I ain't gonna lie I ain't the bomb yet
What do we need? What's the resolution?
Is it restitution or just retribution? Let's just start a revolution
But wait, I'm hesitant because in fact
How can I fight to be equal if the president is black and umm...
A Chi Town resident at that
Hope we focus on us instead of wars in Iraq
The future is bright or will it be weary
Do I need to pay attention to conspiracy theories?
Is the government systematically destroyin' the population for the progress of one dominant nation?
Smile, even if the landlord callin'
Dodge 'em, but that the least of your problems

Mufflin up the mic with funky black licks

Tung be runnin away like a punk be
Rockin, droppin the funk of the manifestation that'll be dope
Scope the point of being wack? Nope, never & no-no
A dancer like a go-go? Oh no
My lip be sort of kickin sort of funky like a hobo
Sucker, I'm like a hype hip-hop gangster gettin dumb
Instead of shooting guns I shoot the tongue
Style Pacino, I'm gunnin em up controllin your casino
Funky like a wino, rhino-dyno like dino
Comin around the corner cappin sucker ducks who be tryin to wreck mine
But my lyrical tongue is like a Tec-9, wastin em
Look at me spillin juice, loose to chasin em
Cut them like tomatoes, then be tomat-pastin em
Facin em, gun to tongue, let's see who'll win this gang member

Froze in December, rock over October, so remember
When I shoot the Tec-9 tongue - timber

Hope the hip hype hip-hop horn struck em down
Climbin, I'm never rhymin Simple like Simon but I'mma do what Simon said
He told me to put that head to bed
Givin an eyeful, funky rhythm of a tongue will stifle
Trifle cause I pop the tongue like a rifle
Watch the funky words pounce
From my mouth watch 40 bounce
Cappin a sucker duck like a 40 ounce
Some flows are wack, but as for me I cause a catastrophe
Like callin Allah God steppin to me is blasphemy
I shoot the tongue like a machine gun
Know what I mean, son?
A chunky spunky tongue if you ever seen one
Cops, I give em props, they cap men, mostly black men
Mouth will pack, then smack em like a Mack-10
Bop - another head flown like a frisbee, it is me
The clips from my lips could drop a Grizzly
Hear me vick, I pack a kick for the ballistic, animalistic
You didn't know my tongue was this quick

I pop the funky gun of hip hop, I hop with hips
Droppin battle ships I put the automatic clips up into my lips
Funky like a drunk, I buck em like a hunter
My rifle will make em stifle like Edith Bunker
Suckers I tag em, my rhythm'll rag em, drag em

Back 2 School,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992," x4
Back to school, let's go back to school
Let's go, let's go back to school; to the oldschool

Let's go back to school to the old school
To the times when the single file lines was the rule
To the days that we had to study all the maps
The days we were kiddin' not to take the kid naps
The days when we used to have to wear the dunce caps
And the days when we used to bust the oldschool raps
Sittin' with your buddy studyin' for ya test
Lookin' back so that you see up under Betty's dress
Couldn't wait for bells to ring so we can go to recess
To kick the battle rhymes just to see who was the best
There were seven emcee's in the 7th grade
I would kick seven rhymes had only seven made
But those seven rhymes we stole
Note the way your toning
I gave the class a blast the way I smash my opponents
Battlin' was serious they've all ducked the fist
Because I kick the funky fresh rhymes like fish
Try to swing but they miss they miss like this
Rasheeda's on the monkey bars blowin' me a kiss
Throwin rhymes back and forth on the see saw
Just to mess with him because I know that he saw
Winkin at Latrice because I know that she saw
Several suckas tried to push us down but we saw
These are the days when the tounge used to rule
Recess is over lets go back to school
 x4

Goin' back to school like Rodney Dangerfield
To the lunchroom where the cooks arrange a meal
Ate the sloppy joe where my friends copy so
We can try to get more than emcees can flow
The fun, fun, fun funky able fable
I stake the style standin' on the stable lunch table
Finish up the rhyme so I can pass it to the next
Throw 'em back and forth 'till we heard the bells flex
Left the lunchroom went to the gymnasium
Up time to flow, we call it a rap stadium
Throwin' rhymes back and forth like a symphany
I wanna start a battle so step to him for me
The whylin' got sensible because we saw the principal
Like grammar school somehow the principal's invicible
Shot a couple hoops the rims are called fruit loops
And if you miss we say opps and leave the gym like troops
Single file line but we were still at the pool
The day is over, tommorrow back to school
 x4

After school I'm home with my mom she's pleased
Cuz rappin help me learn there were never F's and D's
Cuz when I'm spellin bees it would help me stand these
Didn't worry about freaks on the street sellin' keys
Rock the streets beats from the mouth no tracks
Rhymes be simple bust on how they ain't wack
I walk into a battle say what we havin' here
Back in them days I was called a cavalier
Me and baby  used to flow the flows like food
Me and James Phillips used to rock the high schools
Me and Carl Tolta used to rock the neighborhood
Don and Aviator used to show that they were good
Me and Johnny Love used to rock the rock parties
And my brother Johnny kicks a dance to fade everybody
Me and Kingdom Rock used to rock the south blocks
An empire of destruction had emcees on their jocks
The past I have stated, they way we used to rule
Even though we graduated, let's go back to school

Killed them in the past, let's see how futuristic I can get
Arsenal full of lyrics and we be steady stocking clips
Niggas ain't squashing shit, it's the Chicago apocalypse
I bring it back like I done took too many summers off
How I attack make them say, ""Damn, that was some assault""
Flip my money like it was work, call it a somersault
Mad if I'm not on top when it's hot, call it summer salt
Still put them to bed like a Buddha head on Sudafed
Get you high 'til you are dead
Talk that shit, I could put one through the head
Rolling it up, that's what I do with dreads
Open them up, that's what I do to legs
Whip so fly, it don't ever matter which one we in
Flow so illegal the FBI gon' wanna rub me in
Cheque so big, it's like I got a connect with Columbians
Don't want to talk about it if you don't want to cut me in
Stretch the words out like a Benz
Co-creative cause I like to win
The tail on the whip lookin' like a fin
And when I drop the top, it make a sound like a 'eeeeeee'

Get knowledge inside of that, push a button to start it up
People keep askin' me when is the Twista gon' follow up
I'll tell you in a minute after lil' mama swallow up
Nah, had to wait for the label to put them dollars up
Then I can let out some of the connivin' shit that I got bottled up
With a regiment full of soldiers and killers that stay hollowed up
And I can bet murder would be in the venture

Gotta Get Me One,Category F5,2017,"(What happened to the slow jams in the club?)
Category F5, Twista, Static
 (2x)
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her
So I can ease up on her
So I can get touchy feely (touchy feely)
Put a dip in your back
And get me one slow jam
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her (creep up on her)
Everybody's trying to get with somethin'
Can I get one slow jam

When it come to ballin I do it with no hands
Left the Lamborghini home and took the Brougham (damn)
I think the club finna close man
But I be the Twista; you know how I be doing it with the slow jams
Take a look at the shawty chilling by the door man
I'm really into her persona cause she don't be taking drama
But she thick; when I ask her where she get it then she say she get it from her mama
So I think I'mma (what)
Pop champagne cause the glass tall
The bartender said it was the last call
I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance
And I can put my hands on her ass (yes)
And she like it when I hold and grip, control them hips
And you know I like it when she get low and dip
Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip
When they cut the lights on you gon roll with the Twist
Lookin so lovely in the fit you got on
But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you was in some jeans (nope)
Fragrance by Adidas, purse from another country, look at you, girl, you doin your thing!
Everybody leaving with somebody and I gotta get me somebody so I be doin' what I do
Gotta get me one too; before the night go I tell the maestro ""that's your cue!""


When I get on my way to the floor
Baby, hold on to my shoulders
Girl, I won't let you fall
Just hold on to my shoulders

She was lookin nice
Too hot for the Cardi, yeah, she'll melt the ice
Lil mama kinda like Rihanna, she was livin the life
She be givin advice
But just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device
What's that for?  Is your man a boy?
Cause he don't know how to give you what you're here for
I think I gotta show you what the pilot gear for
And the question is ""What I'll whisper in your ear for?""
You nasty, love to be on top
Mad if I pop, if you miss the drop
You nasty, how you made me choke you
Told me I can put it anywhere I want to
Sex so good she do it with no hands
I met you while the DJ was playin the slow jam
As soon as we got into it (into the slow dance)
Is the beginnin of when I was feelin the romance
Now I be Twista with the super tight flow, one might go, that's so true
I gotta get me one; before the night go I tell the maestro ""that's your cue!""

War Ready,Summer 96,2019,"What happened to niggas rappin' aggressive?
You see, when I do it, I be possessed and my flow is so oppressive
And what happened to niggas that got a message?
Niggas be sayin' that they the best and they flow is so possessive
Niggas be thinkin' they got it on lock
With the pea-shooter flows, I'ma defeat you with those
I got some shit I'ma cock and spray up the whole block
Lay 'em down, show 'em all I don't play around
30 shots when I spray a round
I'm on the tip if you follow
I shoot 'em all up with a clip full of hollows
And when I dip, I take a sip of the bottle
Then get Ghost in the whip with the throttle
Get your bitch if she swallow
The epitome of fuckery, if you fuck with me
I'ma be the one that is a rider, too cold for you to matter
You be too exquisite to try to pull it
I could put bullet holes in your designer, deletin' all of your data
All of your intelligence was too artificial
You speak only of irrelevance and you likin' the elegance
Nothin' is real and you ain't even part official
Hit the yellow brick road, you ain't got the heart up in you
Hangin' with nothin' but lames, look at the artist with you
I spit so fast with the words, I could scar the tissue
I bring action to a verb, like a participle
And I designed every bar to hit you, because I'm war ready

Five point seven pistol with the rifle ammunition
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
Desert Eagle with a customized Glock 19
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
I spit it like hot 31 .357 Sig
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
Draco, AR-15, now I'm war ready (War ready)

Bringin' the rest of the regiment, see, if you compete with a veteran
Put you to sleep with the medicine
I'm the reason for doom in the room
See if you could speak with the elephant
In the closet, you a skeleton who bucklin' under pressure whenever confronted with an alliance
Say what you want if you feel I'm biased
I'm the cause of a riot, I don't pretend to be forever
Leave my enemies screamin' like a screechin' of Ferrari tire
The road to recovery but I tell 'em, ain't no comin' back from it
So ain't no need for you to put it in reverse
You can't go back in time, unless it's a memory, pick up your corpse
After you bleed, I'ma put it in a hearse
Go to your funeral, see your mother cryin' like a hyena
Droppin' tears because of a disbeliever who was in my arena
And even though I gave you a glorious death
I was hurt to see it in front of the preacher 'cause I do have a heart
Even though it's part of us, I'm still Spartacus
Led you like Leviticus, or the goddess Artemis
Better yet I'm Amun-Ra through your oculus
I could just see you now with the look of disgust up on your face
To see the way I'm still killin' it
Still ballin' while the shorties drillin' it
Auto-tune fillin' it, but I don't have to interfere with it
Keep it infamous, 'cause I got a style that's infinite, yeah
How I fight, you gotta move the furniture
'Cause I'm a mothafuckin' punisher, and I was born ready
Got my ambition and my ammunition up when my enemies start runnin' up, and now I'm war ready

Five point seven pistol with the rifle ammunition
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
Desert Eagle with a customized Glock 19
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
I spit it like hot 31 .357 Sig
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
Draco, AR-15, now I'm war ready (War ready)

War ready

Five point seven pistol with the rifle ammunition
Now I'm war ready (War ready)
Desert Eagle with a customized Glock 19

Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because of
This cup of Death that was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uhh

They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk

Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what)

Instead of givin en work cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit on the flag is effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin shit I'mma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_

3 Minute Murder,The Perfect Storm,2010,"Uh
Uh
Y'all already know what it is
Niggas talkin' bout ""Twista this"", ""Twista that""
All I know is Twista rap I spit, nigga. Fuck ya'll, check it out

Twis' got skill, yes I kill
I get wild on they ass like Buffalo Bill
I be winnin' in the game like them niggas in the south
If a nigga talkin' shit I'm quick to hit em in the mouth
Them lyrics that's the shit I be equipped to spit 'em out
And I'mma make a nigga sick cause I got venom in the mouth
Antonyms and synonyms are spinnin' him out of his route
And I got bricks of money, bitch and I can't fit em in the couch
Kill 'em with the ride paints hard with the deep dish
Kill 'em with syllables quick wit 8 bars in a sequence
I am the bid'ness I gotta charge you to peep this
Niggas can't see me I'm Ray Charles or a eclipse
Stevie in the blackout see me with the Mack out
Twista gon' get money like a GD in a crack house
When it come to flows I'mma spit 'em like they cold
When it come to niggas heads I'mma split it like a pole
Take away they swag and shit on they cocky style
Cuz my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao
 come solo wit my k-olo
When you see my logo come take my photo when I'm on promo
Niggas wanna get me they better pick a new regimen
Shit too sick B somebody better go get you medicine
Not bringin' up Twista I'm makin' the issue relevant
Balls bigger than mine better go get two elephants
I be getting grimy but you and yo click too elegant
Beat yo face up till yo jaw tissue look like a pelican
I be steady whoopin' yo ass just fo' the hell of it
Can't nobody fuck wit me the planet is celibate
I kick a hot flow, get it like Harpo
Brief when I rhyme 
teeth shine like a car show
Wit a thick bitch, go 'head check out my cargo
You know one gon' be wit me wherever my car go
Where yo baby at, where yo white Mercedes at?
I'll let u borrow the Bentley as long as you bring it back
Here, a couple stacks, you ain't gotta pay me back
Me and yo boss kick it and he know where the ladies at
Whether we comin' and killin' and murderin' cause I beat down the block
Or because I'm like ""throw ya hands up"" cause it's hip hop
I'd rather be rappin' about the streets and makin' a quick pot
But it's time to do something so the shorties don't get popped
Meanwhile back to the lab I got the desert eagle
Come on yo muthafuckin tip and kill eleven people
Throw up on a priest let him know I ain't no reverend
Either dat I go where the fuck I want I'm up in heaven evil
You ain't gotta tell me I know I spit bars sick
E-mail, anthrax, flows kick arsenic
G-up genie and throw it up I'm car sick
Cut raw dope deez nigga cut garbage
Lethargic give a bitch hard dick
See my niggas and I say ""salute"" like a sergeant
Can't lie I'm one of the coldest artists
So I wouldn't have yo bitch up in my apartment
So I be passin' out ""fuck you"" flyers
To fakers and heaters and then fuck liars
If yo' shit ain't one been one minded
The swine flu H1N1 virus
Am I like Jason? No I'm more like Michael Myers
I am the shit I need to wear diapers
When I spit it sometimes I'm all too philosophical
Blame it on the Don Julio and killer tropical
Twista got more swag than a rich sissy
But don't get prissy muthafuckas can get grilly
I'mma balla and a boss and yes I'm finna get paid
Takin' flames to the head like I'm Nicolas Cage
I ghost ride the whip I'm finna get laid
Any niggas dat try to get me is finna get sprayed
One day it's possible dat I'm finna get saved
But for now I be getting money I'm finna get made, muthafucka
Fucka.. ..fucka.. .. fucka.. ..fucka",https://genius.com/Twista-3-minute-murder-lyrics
Party Hoes,Mobstability,UnKnown,"You looking chilliy wit yo thick ass
I know you got plenty niggas out there who trick cash
I damn near caught whiplash as you walked pass
Fucked up the blunt ashes
Peepin your script perpetrating you high
Youz a rat in disguise I see the freak in you eyes
You got between your thighs from fuckin to many guys
And yet still you play the sweet role but we know
That you juggle dicks like slot machines at a casino
I'm high as hell so I'm flaotin
Up in the party tokin
A 44 max and nigga don't jack
Cause I blast away fuck up a niggas whole day
Get the wildin and shoot this btich up in the party
Mobsta style you ain't had a thug in a while
I hit her wit the proposition as she's peepin me out
So whats the lick shorty? Fuck the game me or the lane
She hoped in the Range and then her attitude changed
She said ""I know you fool you one of them Mobsta niggas""
""Who rap wit Twista, wheres he at"" fired up wit some liquor
Hold tight shorty we almost at the City Inn
I told Maze about the lick soon as he buzzed me in
2x
Baby if you want to party tonight
Then let me see you touch your toes
And show me you a party ho
I got my niggas you got your girls
Cause bitch we fucked the world and how do we hurl
Only if you partying ho

I gotta confess I think I'm obsessed wit group sex
Yo lets have a contest and see who do it the best
Inside of Nubian flesh make me wanna get undressed
Tap that ass from the back cause baby your bodies blessed
And your friend to she bend too
Bust out some ginseng brew so I can dick your whole crew
That's the shit I'm into pass some pussy to my guys
Put my dick in your mouth shoot the loogy in your eye
I don't wanna socialize I'm just trying to get bucked
So after you get fucked you hoes gotta raise up
Bumpin out just blaze up big ol' B and the T's
Kick off the party wit you and your homies or your knees
While y'all party to see who got the most superb herb
Nigga Stokes gonna stroke that ass wit the killa curb
Till sober and then do it over again
Cause who ever taste the most dick is the one to win
So open them thighs wide while a nigga slide in
Let me see how many different ways your body can bend
Trippin on Liff spinnin your girl like he gonna miss her
While I'm opening the door for my niggaro Twista


Oh gody what a sexy body you likes to party bitch come on get bucked
I gots to get some if I can't bust one gots to get fucked
Immaculate love get wit the look up at the ceiling lens
A pen of friends bring the Rhemy in I'm sinner sinning sin
Come up inside surprise pour Heny in a glass
Pretties is fast I'm glad squeezing tities and ass
Freakin at last Maze and Liff happy ever so horny
And one of them bonin what I'm gonna do now all of them want me
They slobbin and bobbin steady mobbin and globbin
Like they slob whenever they party
But this big fat thick bitch made my dick hard
No that its swollen she choking
While her cheeks parted open the bitch started stroking
And I'm hoping the girl is hot and soakin, play wit her emotions
Talk about a Chi-Town po pimp
Let's flash the gold and wether or not get the dough gotta grab fo fin
Mo' freaks came thinking I don't want 'em I show
I got a gun, put you mouth around my scrotum and hold 'em
And catchin me bring that ass to me I have to see
Maze broke after me all of us going Ugh!! like Masta P

Drinks,Kamikaze,2004,"(Verse 1: Twista)
I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars
Well I treat bitches like drinks
When I step in the club and by out the bar
So let me quench my thirst with you and a friend
Instead of the juice & gin
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in
Glass full of ass for a true motherfucker
With that that turquoise Coogi on
You remind me of a blue motherfucker
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada
But I think Gina was hotter
Cause her skin tone was like a piña colada
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies
So I ordered them a mai tai and hot sake, then I got cocky
And asked them do they come to this club a lot
Well ya got a brotha hot
Hop in my bubble drop
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita's one wit the karma of margarita
The other one like two shots of tequila
And they all fine I really don't know what to think
As I get bubbly and choose and try to figure out
(Chorus: Highbeam)
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you
(4x)
What's my favorite drink?
(Verse 2: Twista)
Don't want the middle Cosmopolitan ass
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neopolitan mast
No telling what these thick bitches would do
Reminiscent of a big old pitcher of brew
But hit ya like a slow screw
Dip in a strip a club in LA with a bankroll
Where the weather ain't cold
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll
I met two dancers named Moet and Cristal
I was checkin they style
We had a session It was wet it was wild
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remi Red
With skinny legs
Both of them game to give me head
With a little bit absolute vodka for they homie Tasha
Tell her to come closer
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa
If I was mayor I would campaign ass
Drunk politician with women swimming around the champagne glass
Drink so much that I might hurl in the sink
And if you ask me why
I couldn't figure out
(Chorus: Highbeam)
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you
(4x)
What's my favorite drink?
(Verse 3: Twista)
If you would suck my soul
I shall lick your funky emotions
Look at that big old donkey you toting
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop's cup
And have a toast wit King Boo
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck
I holla Church cause its pimps in the party
Let me sip on ya body
Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi
Or a long Island havin sex on the beach
Or in the 'llac sunroof let back with the tech on the seat
Got a red bone I call her strawberry daquiri
Bring her back for me
Carry packs for me
Had her suck off my facultay
Got a little mamma name Mimi
Who remind me of Martini and Asti Spumante
How she move to my cd
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat
She help me shake up dope
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think
As I get bubbly and choose
And try to figure out
(Chorus: Highbeam)
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you
(4x)
What's my favorite drink?
(Outro: Highbeam)
Hennesy mixed wit some of that Alize
Gimme a shot of that Remy
And a whole lot of Tanqueray
Keep it comin with that Cognac
Pop the Moet lets sip on that
Naw playa put ya money back
Cause these drinks on me
Give me a bottle of that Belve'
Long island iced tea
Hook me up a martini
All these dinks on me
I want to have a sex on the beach
How about a gin & juice for me
So put away ya money G
All these drinks on me",https://genius.com/Twista-drinks-lyrics

Why? 'Cause I be on my own shit (woo)
Split a nigga, don't quit (yeah)
I don't do no favors, that ain't logic
Give me my deposit, right a wrong bitch
They say I be actin' Hollywood (woo)
Because I don't be fuckin' with 'em (nope)
Because I won't do nothin' with 'em (right)
They don't know the truth about my personality
They talk about us just to fill in
When they say I'm actin' Hollywood (what?)
Sometimes I gotta be conceited (for real)
Sometimes I feel the people need it (yeah)
They all know that they be hatin' when they be debatin'
But the other people see it
When they say I'm actin' Hollywood
I'm just a Sagittarius (what up?)
I be chillin' to myself in my area
The steps are various to get to this level
I better live vicarious and when you do
When they say you're actin' Hollywood
She made a sound like the sex hurt her
Doors open like south murder
Niggas thought that they can take it to another level
I take it a step further
So they say I'm actin' Hollywood (what?)
They say they wanna catch Twista (damn)
You can't put nothin' past niggas (nope)
So I ain't fuckin' with these nothin' ass bitches
And these nothin' ass niggas
So they say that I be actin' Hollywood (yeah)
Because I will do nothin' to burn with ya (nope)
And half way to hell, I be standin' all over the furniture (yeah)
I have to ask everybody to walk out the room when I be talkin' 'bout shit that ain't concernin' ya
Is that why I be actin' Hollywood? (Why?)
Is it because of the way I can switch up the style?
Or how I can manage to get up on the baddest bitch in the pile
You said it, I be the one that one change but I feel like you be the one actin' different now
That's why I be sayin' you be actin' Hollywood

Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood

With the music, I'm never bound to stop (never)
They tell me I don't come around a lot (I don't)
I just be out on the grind, gettin' steel like the sign on the mountain top
They say I be actin' Hollywood (they do)
If I look at 'em like a object (what?)
Think I'm a youngin' but I'm just a polished Hard' vet (that's right)
They say fuck your entourage and facade
My name on the boulevard, yes
So I ain't actin' Hollywood (nope)
Not until they really care
Not until I eat with a billionaire (yeah)
Not until I make a monster make me check the bank account and see 100 million there
That's when I'm actin' Hollywood (that's right)
When I can help when people hesitate (that's when)
And change the lives of the devastated
Levitated when my mentality is elevated and re-educated
Is when I be actin' Hollywood (lights)
When I ain't feelin' like a threat to you (nope)
Just because you feel I'm ahead of you (why?)
We the same flesh and blood
But because I feel I'm on a higher pedestal
You gotta say I'm actin' Hollywood (I see that)
But I resent that (I do)
Even though I know you meant that (yeah)

Bears heavy on my mind
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
Yeah, keep my mind on my
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger, stayin' on the grind
Now when I wake up in the mornin', I gots to hit a lick
Saw the 2003 Navi' on Spre's with a kick
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin' the block and dodgin' it one time
Peep how we movin' them rocks and the pounds of dro'
'Fore I double my shit, I can serve 16 ounces plus 6 and get back 96
A killer for the scrilla, nigga, best not be stoppin'
I gots to get them bigger, figures, fuck what you talkin'
I represent the niggas ballin' with jewelry full of 'cicles
Down to the niggas chasin' million, that dream servin' nickels
And I know, one day, I'm gon', come up
And when you see me don't hate, that I, roll up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin off 'caine
Until I take a dip in the range, I'm flippin' them thangs
Gotta get some money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that

And when I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' 'em packs
I got a, clip full of hollows, money-makin's my motto
Semi-auto when my blow's in a bottle 'til I hit the lotto
With dreams of ownin' a record label flippin' words
My nigga flippin' buildings better than he was flippin' birds
I got the mentality and the motive, I'm on a mission
For the money you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans and follow procedures
And a six hundred blunted with a pocket full of hundreds and Visas
Love when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cop then I get back up
Love when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grips stack up
And still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin paper products
Soon as I get up, it's just another day another dollar
Gotta get that money mayn
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' Jags
Got love for the thug niggas who get it on the Ave
Love for those who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine strippers who get it poppin' ass
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the haters rollin' bubbles
Causin' trouble every time a young brother try to hustle
And if I can't legally make a knot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
And if it ain't no work we do a stick-up and whip up a concoction
I leave you face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money mayn

Be in control and shit on the other hoes
And be able to get fetti for her daddy from a lot a tricks
But the thump bumpin speakers in the trunk
Cause a nigga have to cop a little some some
Leave a nigga body slump when I let the thumpa dump
If I ever catch you fukin with the bump bump
Like a diamond I'm flawless
Ain't no fucking with rawness
When you enter my vicinity better be cautious
If you into makin money step into my office
Makin hoes close shop

Two for tens got me swoopin' through the city in the drop top
Screamin out I just don't give a fuck

By getting in the 50 yard line and bump and grind
We can get our grub on but I ain't spendin' a dime
Except for (..?..) swisses and wine
I wanna drink until we're boozed at the match of playin' (?)
While I'm takin' you to school we can trip and get cool
And talk about how fun it is to break the rules
Then you do these fantasies to try something new
Baby let me sell you the dream and make 'em come true
It ain't all about sex but we can do that too
Get you something to go back to tell the girls in your crew
I hope you do so I can get with them and tell 'em how you feel

Some with you

It ain't nothin' like bendin' curbs, puffin' herbs
On the mission for derb cause all week all served
Now it's time to lay back with some cogniac
Pullin' up blow, tell 'em where my homies at
Push on that pack tell 'em niggas I'll be back
I got a green broke down for some else to grab
A bitch in school, kicked off the piece and loot
Gettin' derb loverly as we cruise the coupe
Hoes swoop like troops to dive in while I'm drivin'
Got a wave and choosin' a slick nigga who's rotten
Bumpin' it feels good, chokin' on backwoods
With a pocket full of scraps, the sun beams on the wood
It used to be henny but now it's remy (?)
And mo' poppin' got me the (?) with (..?..)
Partyin' with my people as we sit, we're payin' dues

I wanna smoke with you

Smoke with you

Sex you with the different flows, (?) the O's of three different drawers
Pimpin' though to pop a ho, roll in my Optimos
I can illy with the doves, make feelings with the tounge
Henny all the time, fuck that, I really want some fun
Cause this canibus, scandalous, it's romantic, it's Romeo
Look at my 4 forty-O see how much dro we blow
Show for sure, met this click names Swisha lick a low
Hit the demo, tappin' hen (?) on, you know
Now must've been those parties up in (?) with rollies
Then I'm ghost like Obie Kinobie with a bitch and my homie

Where I run up and hoes do shot right up the nose
Come up with those, by the way now girl, now I know you ain't finished
When the sticky menace get in this, we gon' get down to business
Let me smoke with you


Can I smoke with you
Can I, can I smoke with you
Baby can I smoke with you
Baby and your friends too
So baby what'd you wanna do

Steadily freaking you until you don't know how to act

Wide Open,Legit Ballin Vol. 1,1999,"(Erika Kane)
Ugh
I open up wide open and leave those niggas wide open
Hoping for the next supreme stroking dream soaking
Coat in my choking, poking till I'm choking
Niggas croaking never welcome I ain't joking
You know I'm smoking I get the job done

Dirt is awesome superb all tongue suck it like a dum dum
Using mommy as the rule of dumb when you choosing em
Now ya know you fuck with hood rat hoes
Seeing Kane cruising and wanting me and you with them
Cause it went down but you ain't true to them so who is them
I ain't lying shit
Get up with a mady 9 chick that brings like to dicks
With Viagra's lips dips a tits and whips
Leaving dirty tips that chicks while they ride
Kane had hoes around the globe open wide
(Chorus)
Wide open
Like the 7 seas in the ocean soaking like tides rolling
Babs coating she glad stroking
Loving the shit floating the drip
The way you sucking the dick just keep on sucking it bitch
(Erika Kane)
Ugh now let me tell you how I'm working that nigga
Bobbing his dick up and down spiting jerking that nigga

To a hot dick sucking that clit ass licking perverted nigga
Got the nerve nigga pulling out a fat dick
Like a bitch won't get it wet with a slick lip
Lick on the tip with the tit lips
Deep dish how ya tricking on some sweet shits

If you ain't sucking than swallow back of the Tahoe
Mommy had ya happing like problems in sea like macono
Bitch sucking ramodo
Like hitting the lotto when tasting ya nothing
Rub the dick all on my face while this nigga still cummin
Still humming niggas stunning what you tryin to say something
""oooo slow down girl girl shit get back shit girl""

Purple Swag (Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(This is for my niggas getting high on a regular

Purple drank but I'll be flowing so quick

Feel the spark force from a dark horse
When I drop them down I kill them
So get ready to have the blunt torched
Bottom niggas with the 2 seaters
With the 2 liter bottles full of Sprite and
Codeine on the front porch
With that, texas style, chi town
Horror flow, the person on the front page article
To break the big chunks down into particles, that's right

Check That Hoe,The Day After,2005,"Twista, first time I kicked it off with ""Adrenaline Rush""
Next album I kicked it off with ""They Kill Us All""
This time I'mma show you how to ""Check That Ho""
Check it out

Take a look at the way that I came
Hard times, long road, mean streets
Motherfuckers back up off me
When they look at the way that I aim
Put the bullet in your brain when I ride nigga
Got it out when you interfere or fuck with the boss
If you disrespectin' me I'm reposessin' like you catchin' the Holy Ghost, make him die like he touchin' the cross
Now you spiritually commited suicide nigga
I got the power to get diamonds and riches and gold
Motherfuckers tried to get it with extortion
But I'm too vicious for blows
And I'm checkin' these bitches and hoes
Make a shower full of hollow point bullets rain on 'em
For yo' death you got me lookin' in my itinerary
If I ain't got you scheduled to be dead where the men are buried
I think I can fit you in other cemetery
Like a disciple of death I'm bringin' pain on 'em
I can see nobody playin' me like I'm a punk
I'mma let you know off top if you come at me bogus
And there's more than one of y'all if I gotta strap I'mma dump
You done made me a murderer from the Westside
Haters come at me smilin'
But really they wanna fuck up a nigga hustle
So I just get bubble, smokin' bubble
When I try to just stay out of trouble
But some shit you can't let slide - you better check that ho

If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name
Nigga you better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho
If a nigga come at you in the club
Talkin 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck
Nigga you better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho
You and somebody put in half and half
And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then
You better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho
If you get played for a bird and some herb
All you got is your balls and your word
Nigga you better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho

I just wanted 'em to see what my city was like
Hip-hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein' murdered
I just wanna feed it poetry Pedialyte
I'm a black revolutionary in hip-hop
I just wanna hit the Earth like a meteorite
Now droppin' lyrical bombs upon the planet
And just get a little dust and avoid all the media hype
Fuck the drama I'm just campaignin' Chi right
Niggas feel like they position is better than mine
But I stay on a mission,
 I'm on the grind
Takin' no prisoners, I can see 'em gettin' mo' cheddar than mine
How I flow make the dough get larger
Take over with an immaculate verbal assault
Just to do it the way I'm doin' it, rollin' how I'm rollin'
Motherfuckers is gon' have to just go in the vault
Shit on niggas in the oh-six Charger
When it come to titles you know that I'm holdin' 'em
I've been down since the days of breakin' on linoleum
'Til Kanye preach and ""Jesus Walks"" right up at the podium
Now let me speak about the prophecy of Twista
Just when you thought you was worse, I'm bringin' you a hearse
I make you feel the heat and cold when I'm tellin' the street scroll
I got you feelin' the universe through the verse
The way I'm teachin' it has got to be a scripture
So look at me like I'm a prophet on top of the game
Puttin' money in my pocket for the way a nigga rock it
And I bet if I'mma cock it I'm poppin' the thang
And if I ain't strapped then I gotta whoop ass
So I take off my pinky ice; if a nigga come at me with some bullshit
Or fuck me out of money I steal on him like Winky Wright
Hit you with the left hook fast - you better check that ho

If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name
Nigga you better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho
If a nigga come at you in the club
Talkin 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck
Nigga you better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho
You and somebody put in half and half
And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then
You better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho
If you get played for a bird and some herb
All you got is your balls and your word
Nigga you better go check that ho
You better go check that ho, fuck that ho",https://genius.com/Twista-check-that-hoe-lyrics
Intro / Freestyle,Back to the Basics,2013,"Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ahh
Back again motherfuckers
Twista, Traxster, ahh

Come peep a legend and a boss burn one
Floss words, rappers that can break me off, heard none
I'm droppin' crack until the crosswords come
Got the thirty but I spit it like a Mossberg pump
If you give me trouble you see me deploy
Lyrics so butter you think I'm W.E.B. Du Bois
If you see me pull up in the bubble you greet me with noise
Keep your poise, but really you wanna see me destroyed
Acronym for me is D.O.C., I'm the O.G
Destroyin' all competition that's in my way because I'm G-O-D
You amount to nothin' if in my circumference or area
The Sagittarius in the Age of Aquarius
You act like you ain't know the veteran can go
And I be killin' them, in some instances better than befo'
Then I got ahh, crooked letter to the O
Severin' your throat, now they like ""Who let him in the do'?""
No matter how you Google it then doodle it
What'll really make you the shit is how I see you make use of it
Crucifix and holy water won't stop the way he get
So crazy and sick, evil like I took a sip of Damian's fifth
Off Canadian's mist, Arabian piss, a Ukranian's fist
Spit so nice they be like ""It's an alien's gift""
You pay me in bricks and I'mma show you a way we can flip
Or I'm clappin' like ""What Happened to That Boy"" like Baby and Clipse
Come talkin' shit 'bout what you do I'll bet you be the first
That might come up missin', I'll make sure that you don't need a hearse
I'm on a mission, don't come through unless you bring in work
I'm dissin', ammunition I'mma shoot until my fingers hurt
Then I'mma shoot some more if I can squeeze
'Cause you borin' while I'm soarin' like I'm Thor or Socrates
War as I conceive that the breath of horror I can breathe
Even though you servin' defense I be scorin', droppin' threes
All in my grill-y like you can throw them thangs
I'm insane while you prefer Novocain over pain
For talkin' shit tonight my bitch'll blow your brains
'Cause he thought the weakness was kryptonite, it was Lois Lane
I boss you like a parent apparently darin' ya
Scarin' ya if you're there when I get to airin' the derringer
The mini-carrier that's knockin' down your barrier
Bury ya, expose 'em like I threw a flare in your area
Carry your body off to the woods and get rid of it
You're rottin' while I go get some pot and then take a hit of it
Then I'mma try to come up with some different shit
While I'm draggin', like if rap was a dragon I am the spit of it

Enough to make a bitch stay
If you could last a bitch
You might make a bitch pay with your trashy dick
On the stroll around the way
Every hoodrat got the same thing to say

Need the dick to stay hard all god dam day

Got em sprung work em bend up the nigga
The dick to sensitive for me to suck ya nigga
And if ya keep tricking i might fuck ya nigga

And if you eat the pussy right nigga thats a plus

Treat a bitch like a queen and have me living plus

Girl it ain't no other way to describe you
Your momma raised you right
Yeah, I like that, it's like

Sittin here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and girl now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back (uhh)
You my homie we go back (uhh) thank you for the love rehab (uhh, uhh)

Doin bad, ain't nobody in my life
I'mma kill a nigga or somebody gon' murder me soon
I'm a hope fiend, I need a woman in my life
Could you take me to the emergency room?
I need somebody that can nurse me back to health
Cause I'm out here lovesick, shakin like Pookie
You took me up outta the hoopty
Put me in the Lex 300 and got me blowin on dookie
Now why do I respect ya, cause she down for a nigga
Before I was rollin city to city
She got me screamin out yessir, like I'm Pretty Ricky
Lookin freaky freaky while I'm smokin the sticky-icky
When I'm down and out, you be rubbin my back
Because I miss you, you know I got issues
When I'm ridin dirty and I got the thumper
And the law pull me over you will hold my pistol
Sick of how the women harm on me, you charmin me
In the pharmacy of love, body be right I wanna hit you
You like a veteran when I need some medicine
You better than Exederin, fellas in trouble that wanna get you
I thought I knew what real love was 'til I met you
I'm reminiscin on the love we had
I'mma stay sick forever hope I never get well
Cause you got me in a love rehab


So many problems, so many people, so many decisions
So many roads that I have to choose (yeah)
But still I'll roll the dice and pray that I don't lose
There were times that I got weak, fell short
I couldn't go on and, she came through
So many friends, so many liars, so many haters
Sometimes I just don't know who to trust
But yet and still I turn the wheel of life and try my luck
There was a time when I was broke, didn't have a job
And this woman, she showed me love
Ohh, since we first met, I've risin like an escalator
Now five years later, we have come up like an elevator
You made me better babe, when I thought I was goin crazy
I was just about to lose my mind, then you put me in your love rehab


If I hit it I'mma spit that love flow
Forget what they all say
She the only one that helped me
Hit her with a little bit of ""12 Play""
When the Twista wasn't proper sippin Vodka
I could remember tellin the love doctor I need some help
Through the fire like I'm shocker, love it every time I rock her
Cock a pistol when I think I bleed to death
My surgeon, and my methodome
The only one I talk to when I'm left alone
You the one that helped me fight through my challenges
Tell me what's my psychoanalysis
I thought I knew what real love was 'til I met you
I'm reminiscin on the love we had
I'mma stay sick forever hope I never get well
Cause you got me in a love rehab


Uhh, Kell's and Twist'
Gotta let her know that she the only reason we make it through sometime

I Am Such A Mobsta,Dark Horse,2014,"I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
So come and bow down to royalty
Kiss both of my cheeks to show loyalty
The flow is ceremonial, the style of rituals so be cordial
And please act accordingly

This ain't a legend or folklore
Chi-raq violence is real, not a Cold War
But in the streets call it coke wars
And do not open your mouth unless you spoke for
Please Father forgive me
I had to give him two to the kidney
Didn't know that I was nice
Any night I perform like Rice - Jerry, Sydney
Ray too, hangin out with Windy City gratefuls
In the back of the club we play pool
Only real niggas cause they cool
And who did bids and didn't snitch and stayed true
But now-a-days family come first
Shorties out here is gettin killed over turf
Well if the meek shall inherit the earth
Tell me why I gotta know what a hundred bricks is worth?
...Ah, flow so gorgeous
The coldest to ever touch a cordless
I'm on the streets Forbes List
And with the rhymes I'm divine like Osiris, Horus
It's a clash of the titans
Warriors on the street blastin and fightin'
Seen it all, been a part of it all
Don't get it twisted if I'm on a different path when I'm writin

I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""

Blowin loud by the quarter
Conversations about what's up with a porter
We can sit down at the table, but first
You gotta kiss the pinky ring, it's according to the order
My niggas show me how much to cut it with
And what to do when the kitchen was the workplace
Bring the pot over the stove to a boil
Comin out the crib smellin like burnt paste
As the Lord is my witness
I done seen so many end up on the hitlist
Shootin the car 'til it slow down
And now I see nothin but lifeless, stiffness, hit this
Three-eighty in the headset
Bricks in the dashboard and the door panels
Give me the ball nigga, hand check
Niggas can't ball cause they got poor handles
So with a wave of the hand
I'ma gain green if I offer them work
Create a chain of command
Don't try to talk to me unless you talk to him first
...In God we trust
And it ain't another Mob like us
Pocket full of eightballs on the bus
To undercovers I say what's up in the truck
Whole team full of bravado
Gettin money since niggas that wore Movado
Rollin in a Cadillac El Dorado
Bubble Lexus or the all-black Tahoe

When I was bumpin Melly Mel before I was makin hella mail
Sportin Pelle Pelle you was thick as hell
All my homies in the industry'll love you
When it come to suckin dick you lookin like you lick it well
With a old school fatty, make a nigga wanna take it back
When you let me hit it from the back
When you come in the room and take it off
I'mma have to break it off to an old school track
When I'm lookin at the way you be shakin your rump
Be makin me wanna come fuck you, no fakin the funk
And when your lil' gangsta bitch mode take place
Make a nigga wanna bump the first face take
It's like a jungle sometimes that make me wonder
How I keep from goin under and I wanna be your lover

If the plane make your head hurt, here's an aspirin
We on the ski lifts off in Aspen, so what's up, what's happenin?


So what do you do besides stand around and look pretty, hmm?
Or do you get paid to do that? Ah-ha, see, I knew that
I bet Diddy'll think you're pretty, and Mekhi Phifer gon' like you
Leave her alone LeBron, and oh be careful Tyson'll bite ya
Wow, just like my new place, ooh I'm going to decorate you
And I'mma be honest, most of the women there are going to hate you
But what can you say boo, you all in they way boo

All into good rushin', touchin', better roll when I flush 'em
I'm causin' concussion, sportin' pellet, come here baby
My way will change, I used to kinda rugged my day
Let's dance, while we get our groove on I get known
If it's on, then Lexus she gon' get home
First get bucked up and sip on
G on the room and drink po wine up in the whirlpool
Don't leave my comb and pearl too
Leavin', let the girl cool my world, ooh
I like to get down, straight up you're freaky
You wanna meet me, just beep me, take the (?) and weakling
Drop the top and leave haters wishin' the (..?..)
Let's keep it a hood thang, you get busy on wool grain
I treat you precious as diamond rings, so don't cut me up
I start the fussin', I'mma get the bustin', now no thang, I gotta give it up
Cause all your love can make the hardest thug cry like a dove
Pull my mink over your shoulders when we leave out the club
Ain't no need to knock a con, I'm feelin' like Chaka Kahn
She the bomb like Lebanon, still fine with no Revlon
Just let the Don inside, I promise pleasure and sweat
I guarantee you ain't gon' be no regrets
If you just let me get it wet


Baby I'm fine, want you to be on my pager
I wanna know you, we can kick it like players
(..?..) make me really want you
Let me in your world
How can a man leave a woman like you're lonely
But still some phonies, call me when you need me
Sit down with my homies, pull up in my Lexus
Let me in your world

I need love, it's off the hizze, think you can please me
Don't hurt me, take it easy girl, we on the E-Way
You know you met me when I crashed the bar
And why'd you kissin' on my neck, I'm 'bout to crash the car
So pass the 'la, relax baby it ain't far
Since you started askin' me questions on gossip about stars
Girl you better be on script on who you with
She's been forcin' Liffy Stokes from the mobsta click

I'm chillin' at the click, with nums getting numb, I bumps
Tryin' to find a cutie to kickin' with, watch the risin' sun
Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back
What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack
Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track
Big and black, had attention ready to dig in that
So what we just met, that don't mean I won't give you respect
I just fight the temptation to get your body real wet

Ahh, keep givin' them hand claps, baby
Watch them speakers be harmed
And the bass be soft, ooh
Ahh, keep givin' them hand claps, baby
Watch them speakers be harmed
And the bass be soft, ooh

On my elevator you can feel our love rise to the top
Cause on the way up to my condo, your ears pop
When I hit the lock I'm a villain, the mobstas make the killin'
As we lay on my waterbed with the mirrors on the ceiling
The wall too, got friends that's all true, I call Cru
Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you
Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos
VIP, who gets who, no dancing with two left shoes
Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood
Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good
Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these
Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh
Haters please, no bustin' we up in place
Put 'em in the trunk, the flame
When I'm tryin' to get up with ""what's her name""
The precious tonight I met, let's ride, I feel this like a set
While you're dancing, I'mma kiss off the sweat
That's how you let me get it wet


Baby I'm fine, want you to be on my pager
I wanna know you, we can kick it like players
(..?..) make me really want you
Let me in your world
How can a man leave a woman like you're lonely
But still some phonies, call me when you need me

He don't make you feel like I, do he? Do he?
He don't drive the car I drive, do he?
He ain't gettin money like I, do he? Do he?

Every minute I be in it
Every minute I be in it, I be killin competition
Watch I break 'em from the start to the finish
I make 'em start to diminish and body anybody
Makin a comment about me the way I don't like
Disgruntled motherfuckers and suckers, today we call 'em haters
I'm so major, hoes on me and they wanna fight
They wanna bite cause I'm original like Bobby Digital
My style is critical and yours intermediate
I'm just a rappin legacy, I got the recipe
For cookin up and servin, and they likin the ingredients
Im mackin, I'm a genius, a flow of horror, I could peep your
Aura and see what your inner feelings might be
Niggas talkin shit cause they ain't used to bein
In the same room with a legendary nigga like me
Some of 'em really wanna be me and they want my car, ho
And they flow like me
Niggas wanna take away my style, they can get it how I get it
But they money never grow like me though
How I live it is exquisite and the picture is so vivid that the riches
Are not only monetary but within the body and the mental
Spectacular graphics in back of a plethora of energy
Vocally vibratin rhythms through a instrumental
Spit and tellin niggas you don't really want it
Bitches you don't really want it
Think I'm dissin even when it's hypothetical and I ain't really on it
I'm known to body my opponents
Should I say opposition, in my position I'm expected to be venomous
I beat 'em down verbally the way I rap
Like it was multiples of me, I fuck 'em up like it was ten of us
And this ain't even strenuous

She gon' pop the thang for real nigga, nigga

Every second I be intimate
Every second I be intimate with the music
As I get into it and every ryhthm in the instrument
Intelligently ignorant the way I spit it
Admit it, I'd be admitted into the hospital
If I didn't know how I spit'll be the conversation of lyricists
Congregation'll fit with this, I'll leave you volatile
If you got a style you probly got it from hearin Twist
A certain section of my '97 patterns
My 2004 lyrics, how they copy
Cadences and mannerisms, I can tell it when I hear it
I can tell it when I hear it
And I'm never specific cause if I do
A nigga gon' take it the wrong way
I'll fuck him up for whatever he gon' say
Dependin on who he be I'm thuggin like I'm PeeWee Longway
Blowin after a long day
And I want my haze, kush
And my diesel too
How you ain't gon' have nothin to roll up with me
If you gon' fuck with me if I be blowin weed with you though?
Old fake-ass niggas, they be the reason I don't fuck with them
All over the dick when they see the Gucci
I just roll one up and say rest in peace to Doe B
Blowin for when they free my lil' brother and free Lil Boosie

But that don't mean I can't call you, beautiful
Girl, I know your name
But that don't mean that, I can't call you, beautiful

Still I'm just wishing
When it come to looking for her, I am still on a mission
When it come to looking for love, can you feel a position
Can you feel a prescription, tell me are you still a position
The thrill is your listing, I'm tripping cause I feel like you different
I can see both of us dipping to the  kissing
Your vicious ass, so thick, don't give a shit cause you glisten
Delicious vag don't gotta hit the whip for no fishing
Got me caking like Napoleon
So fine, I can't stop watching, like you pop locking and breaking the 
Eyes is pop locked in place ain't no controlling them
Drop  for the church when I see you at the podium
Like coming to America, I try to let you know you stunning when I stare at ya
That's why I call you (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)
Looking so fine when you step in the party, you gotta shine all over your body that's why I call you (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)

I know your name
But that don't mean I can't call you, beautiful
Girl, I know your name
But that don't mean that, I can't call you, beautiful

It's the fact that you're beautiful, pardon me but that's the reason I'm acting unusual
Well done, it's everything back 
to which
 I do to you , get your nails and push the haters back like the cuticle
Macking I do to you, that's why the black is so suitable
Consoling her like she just came back from a funeral
Unhold another beauty that she got is not losable, I roll with her cause the top on the lac is removable
I feel like in a major way, 
she got a man  fade away
It's safe to say I wanna take you out places I know these dollars would get you
Popping bottles cause I know you got the model potential
To walk across the runaway, ain't you smart enough to become a lawyer someday
That's why I say that you (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)
So fine you are such an intrusion, on the computer you look like an illusion so I say you are so (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)

Girl I know you need my love (need my love)

Now, everything that I want in a woman
When I be lookin' at her body and her mind that's you
Me bein' able to give you what you want or what you need
When I'm becomin' a love, that's true
Please pose because when you do that
I know I could never say that the romance is through
D. Rose when I be comin', the whistles send you to a victory of an orgasm too
Have her with me when I kick back
When she roll one, I lit that
She a cold one the way she lick that
When I hit that she hit back, AOWWW!
When I give it to her how she wanna get it'll be the way to make her crazy
And every time that she see me on the TV screen she like ""There go my baby""
Cause I be fuckin' her, she like the way I'm freakin' her, how I'm freakin' her
I'm the one I know she wanna be with
Make the call, what time you want me to pick you up? (you up)
Tell him you got somethin to do when I hit you up - because


Girl I know you want it, girl I know you want it
Girl I know you need it, girl I know you need it

How I'm mackin' you could tell that I want yours
I can see that it's obvious that you want mine
This could be reality far from folklore
When I look at your body and you be so fine
Like a coke line, the way she after me gotta be somethin else I could tell she addicted
All on me like an methamphetamine but a better fiend
She was thick as hell so we kicked it
She became a follower, but she was a swallower
Got up with her cause I wanna see when she go bottoms up
The way she turn her bottle up - oh you a nasty girl
And you know that I'm the same way, and you like that shit, so don't give up
Cause we gon' fight, and we gon' fuck

Why you steady standin' there talkin' that shit? B-Hype gon' go to the trunk
Unload the fivers, SKs and millimeter choppers
I got niggas that be killers with some shit that when you shoot it on the block it sound like a helicopter
It's hard out ch'ere, motherfuckers ain't got no work
It's a few niggas got cocaine, few niggas got dope, most niggas got purp'
Lil' nigga tried to play you shady, instead of yellin' out three folks and almighty
They be talkin' 'bout '80s babies, shorties that was born in the '90s is grimy
No respect and no morals, actin' like you owe that shit
Fuck up out my face big homie, matter fact gon' load that shit
It done got so crazy up in the streets sometimes I can't believe that this my land
Lil' girls used to wanna fuck a dope boy, now they wanna fuck a stick-up man

Open up the door and you will see

I got a couple things that we can do
I just had to call ya

Big T and I'm from Chicago
You know I gotta represent the city doe
A nigga fin' to shoot a new video
So I'm fin' to take a trip out to Cali yo
Took a flight, ten of us in a group
Hit the West coast, now I'm fuckin with Snoop
Told a few hoes to come up to the shoot
And she was lookin so cold pullin up in the Coupe
Pretty skin tone, a nigga got y'all
Soon as I took a look at them big brown eyes
Fat ass, my dick got hard
Soon as I took a look at the big brown thighs
Too sassy, bet you doin nasty
And I can tell it when I'm lookin at the way you walk
Thick lips, ready for suckin
And a nigga wanna fuck you when I listen to the way you talk
I'mma do it like this when I drop at you
Let you know that I'm the Twist' when I pop at you
Comin at you in the Mission Impossible
Let's go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
Then as soon as we leave we gon' have to go and get naughty
Then when I come back {*chirrp*} (hello?) Whassup shawty?

Had to call you.. comin through..
Me and you.. I had to holla..
I'm 'bout to shoot through there right now, dig
Girl hook up the phone, pick it up quick
It's Snoop Dogg, you know you gotta get wit
The game that I spit, the way that I rip
Let's, go and do, this
Ride, ride, slip and slide
I'm comin by, let a nigga inside
What we gon' do, it's all upon you
What I say, what it do?
Do - no not you, you know I got to
And if you got me, then I got you
I'm a player, youse a player
We some players, so we should play a
Game, do yo' thang
Ain't it mayne, turn the lights off
Hit the right spot {*oooh*}
Make me feel how I wanna feel
But it can't happen if you ain't real
Don't, you, play with me
Come and spend, the day with me
Everything is everything
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dopest of 'em all
Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in
They say Dogg you walk it too much
And you may think I'm talkin too much
But then again I reminisce
I miss that hug, I miss that kiss
I miss that love
Really cuz, I miss that bitch

And I love it when you hit that switch
Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the fuck did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit
That's right - had a nigga feelin so good
That when I had went home
I was thinkin 'bout you so hard
That I couldn't help but to pick up the phone

And I just had to call ya; I'm lovin how you look and how you smell
And you got a ass fat as hell
I just had to call ya; girl I'm lovin what you do to me
You break me off and then put me to sleep
I just had to call ya; I got a couple things that we can do
Just let me know if I can come through
I just had to call ya; cause you got a bomb on the 'dro
And you got some good deep throat",https://genius.com/Twista-had-to-call-lyrics

This is where it's at
Where Common and Nelly and Eminem and Kanye West
We got that crack
I love the dirty
Cause the trap remind me of K-Town
Full of sheisty ass niggas
But the true ones gon' stay down
But on the East-Coast they want lyrics in the do'
So I get up in the middle of the sight ful
Then I (Spit another flow)
And when I hit the West
I blow 'sess everyday
Get up with showski of fourty
When I'm in 'Frisco water bay
And when I'm in L.A
I get up with Snoop and The Game
In a lot full of sixty fo's
Red and blue all on them thangs
And when I'm in the Chi
It's Crucial or Do or Die
Come and walk with the god
Take a journey, just you and I
They asked me to shake it for 'em
So they can take a glance
It's get money game mobstas
Gangstas don't dance

Let the mink sweep the flo', as cold as Chicago
Ground full of snow, table full of snow

And dare one of you bitch niggas to try to take it from me (Nigga)

But never get it twisted, I'm a livin' of a villain
When I clap, I spray

I ain't wired right
I ain't wired right
I'm 'bout to set this bitch on fire
I ain't wired right!
I ain't wired right, nah
I ain't wired right
Cause a blackout in this bitch
Now can I get a witness, haa?

Better be scared of my legacy, homie
You won't diminish mine
Finna curl swing with a verse, like a nigga first
To cross the finish line
Who would'a ever thought a nigga in the game
20 years and still be in his prime
I eat up that new
Motherfucker you finna sign
Fiercely in it, Chi-Town
But you think I put a little bit of Philly in it
If I said it, then I really meant it
Tear a nigga up like an Achilles tendon
Better yet an ACL, they see hell, when I hit the dank
Get 'em in the paint, stick 'em with a shank
Celebrate and roll another round of kush
Hit it till I'm feelin' like a nigga finna faint
You don't like what I said, screw you
You don't know what I said, ""SCREW ME""
Texas style, I can wreck this style
Like I was a Mossberg or an Uzi
Nigga, for you to be called, I'mma see
If you can spit cause I can serve a hater on a platter
With the security code of a G
So you can never tap into the data or the data
The ultimatum is I gotta be strong in a whole city full of fiends
That's why my niggas stay holdin' metal like Wolverine
The cause-a-riot type
But me, I'm the quiet type
They be the ones that you really gotta watch out for
Cause they ain't wired right!

I ain't wired right
I ain't wired right
I'm 'bout to set this bitch on fire
I ain't wired right!
I ain't wired right, nah
I ain't wired right
Cause a blackout in this bitch
Now can I get a witness, haa?",https://genius.com/Twista-i-aint-wired-right-lyrics

Don't get me wrong I won't put you in danger the nature of the streets
Ready to claim another life asking God to save us forgiven hearts
The tamers the youth is hard to train em
They only want money and cars status and stars living ghetto famous
Ain't this the shamest lets resolve the changes so they won't be namest
Broke starving and banging

Motive for Murder,Mobstability,UnKnown,"*Liffy Stokes*
The stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul
Im 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole
I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying
I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying
Not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball
While waiting for this pussy ass job to call
And it ain't hopping
Got me tipping to hear them things popping
Cash bags dropping
With plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking
Its what I'm on
I cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone
24 years and grown with a future unknown
My heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game
But I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane
So its back to pistols and cane
Plotting on licks hitting stains
The mob life runs through my veins
Its too late for me to change
These streets got me deranged
Strapped up and paranoid
Ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid
Plus big voices getting hot
They constantly sneaking on blocks
They trying to bring me in unconscious
But them pins got popped
Now they got me on the run
Cherishing every last breath
But I ain't going back
Its freedom or death
That be my motive for murder
Begin*CHORUS*
*Liffy Stokes*
Now I know you the judge of life and death
I ain't evil or nothing
But somebody done brought me pain and sorrow
So I'mma have to kill something
Let me count the ways that I can repent
Trying to stay holy and focused
But that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus
That be my motive for murder
*Twista*
I'mma survive these streets another day
I know the pain in my heart won't go away
These mother fuckers try to murder me
And won't nobody hurt my family
Thats what he gotta die
End*CHORUS*
*Mays*
9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick
If it ain't coming up with the dopest shit
Then I'm trying to cop the thickest brick
Cause life in the belly of the best
Is equal to povertys bottomless pit
Where bitch niggas trick
And thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get
But it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick
Before its too late to get straight
And the most I make is final pick
Anywhere they shit like riding slick
With a thick chick slobbing your dick
Even if it means fighting these niggas in cases
As long as neither ones thick
Cause I swear when I get hit
I go in a crucial rage like a flick
Turn straight lunatic
Making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick
But that don't mean my minds sick
Just cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese
When trees by the p's
And fuckin fine fee's and 3's with ease
For sho the skilled poets
Within in the mask up kill for it
I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill
I'll bet his dumb ass'll stil blow it
Bullshit ain't nothing
I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank
And drive a bullet-proof hummer tank
So the next haters who try to air me out come up blank
And I'mma have to sacrifice your life
With a wrath thats stronger than christ
And forces of life thats know to do damage to human eyesight
I guess its true
Moneys the route of all evil
Cause crooked or legal
Its all manipulated by the eagle
And be my motive for murder
*CHORUS*
*Twista*
Lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start
How I'mma hide love for this mob
This nigga made my homie die in my arms
Had to put a slug in his heart
Mother fuck that slug
It was just a grudge on his part
My boy was young and ambitious
Took his dreams and wishes
Try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches
Drowning all my sorrows in bottles of 'nac
And a quarter ounce of dro on my lap
I'm bout to snap
Here come the big pay back
Looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap
I'm crying and shit
I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him
Even if a slug hit him
I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him
Can't control them pains
Now its time to throw them thangs
Visions of the stud on sight
Empty the clip of air him out right
Ambulance come around
By the time the hypes
Taking of his nikes
I know it sound cold
But this bullet put a hole in my soul
Left his shorties years throwed
He was only 17 years old
And at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll
And I know he used to wild sometimes
Carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine
No more reminising on the fun times
Balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines
But this nigga ain't going to want mine
For the pain I'mma handle this flunk and dismantle this junk
Fuck all that
In all black and then pumped
To run up on this nigga
Tip up on him then dump
Mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
Eyes gleam with the fury
Never thought I'd be facing to 2 murders
In front of a prosecuting team and a jury
How did one murder turn into 2
Revenge had me shooting through hate
I couldn't stop
In the mist of the action
Is when that little girl got shot
All because of my motive for murder

Yeahh
Oh we do body bags in the winter
Yes sir
Get you a right nigga to do it
Yeahh

Woke up smelling gun powder
Didn't wanna smell it no more so I blew a blunt of sour
Take three months to devour
The city of Chicago
Diablo in the shower
The late can't cool niggas off
Play roles in the movies
But pussy can't fool niggas dog
Fuck Chiraq
Put the sun in my backpack
So much shit going on I wanna go back in my dad's sack
But since I'm here I'm something to fear
Looking way ahead of me nothing is near (Bang!)
Gun shots that make you jump in the rear
Blast from the past passing the grass up at the pier
Call me Mr.Grand Avenue
I blow two grams and laugh at you
You know what's going on when I blam at you
Vic Spencer the worst rapper that hurts rappers
You in the dirt faster
Bodies in the dumpster with the maggots

Dispenser this from the bodies x3
Have you dying like Chris Farley
Pour grammes on the Harley
Until somebody departs me
Dispenser this from the bodies x3
Have you dying like Chris Farley
Pour grammes  on the Harley
Until somebody departs me

Take shots like medicine, watch out and better get all ball
Get the shit the fuck out of here I'm better than all y'all
I be the one that's gon deliver whenever y'all call
Working the kitchen funkier than chitterlings and hog maws
Y'all blow when I think about what rhymes with Vic Spencer
Tryna figure it out, smoking weed from my dispenser
They unappealing why my flow rifle so vital
Have you danced on the ceiling like some throwback vinyl from Lionel
My pants sag even though I got on the Gucci belt
Cause I let them see it just so I can see how they coochie felt
This is the flow for the hotter mama
The dollar dollar
Milk from Cambodia
Powder water from Guatemala
OG and I'm making dollars like I was drag racing
Hop out the phantom in my pajamas at the gas station
Don't talk no shit cause eventually you gon starve me
And mentally you gon charge me
To a Spencer and we gon party

Dispenser this from the bodies x3
Have you dying like Chris Farley
Pour grammes on the Harley
Until somebody departs me
Dispenser this from the bodies x3
Have you dying like Chris Farley
Pour grammes on the Harley
Until somebody departs me",https://genius.com/Twista-mortuary-lyrics
Adrenaline Rush The Saga Continues,Adrenaline Rush 2007,2007,"What happens when you combine the darkness with the light?
I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses
And the pain from these here, motherfuckin' verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses to the dirt, shit
First picks and use 'n autos to work with slugs to the shirt, shit
(Just to squirt shit)
A wicked hit with an expert kick and burst 'til the earth split
Leave you hurt bitch, show you how worser than worst
Get in the zone, see the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin' the curtains, bitch
(When adrenaline's pumpin')
I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high
Got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
I'm charged off of suckers gettin' shot up off the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(So tell me what it said)
Retaliate with lethal repercussion, I feel the reefer rushing
To go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal
To get the kickin' shit for niggas and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
It's like some lead bust 'cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' head bust when you jumped up
'Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed
From smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act like a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westside'll
Let the shit go on and ride when the trigga bust
(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
Pullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit
Start up buryin' some heads like an ostrich
And unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What I've accomplished
Yungbuck's my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
And starting on a journey established to stop this
Rushing up the hearts of other niggas to get 'em charged
What's the real reason?
All you haters try to murder me so now it's kill season
And even though I'm still bleedin'
I'm comin' after you cause I'm still breathin'
And y'all can't trace me
I bury my victims in the wall like Gacey, too lyrical
And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
My music is miracle like I'm biblical
Killin' like I'm nuttier than buddy love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up
And speed the fuck up getaway smokin' this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin' my veins I'm pumped up
And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees
See that's 300 niggas that's gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed
(Psycho Drama)
We too much for the industrialistic fuck
With this on the brink of fuckin' up some shit
Dismantle, deduct some shit
It's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
(What niggas got nerves to do)
So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you
Then think what I'm on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo curtains fool
From killin' the verses fool, I be one of the worstest dude
(You, the who?)
I'm the worstest workin' about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose, bitch you hurtin'
(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

Pray For Me,Legit Ballin Vol. 2,2001,"(Todd Nitty)
Here's the tale of a young black male
Raised in these city streets
Out here hustling to make ends meet
In a world thats so corrupt
Thats ran by greed
Money and the power
For me I'm a survivor
I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that
So before you cash your stones down on me
I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror
And ask somebody to pray for you
Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand
I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers
Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla
In the city of Chi the home of the G's
If ya dont work ya dont eat that's been the code of the streets
As for me I was brought up at an early age
Learned how to cook cane started to gang bang
And its a damn shame I chose game
But see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame
And I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights
And be wondering which nigga wanna take my life
Until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters
(chorus)
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Oh I pray
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends
My whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam
Man I dont know whats in store for me god
Will I reach 21
Why is life so damn hard
See thats the question thats asked
And is there a heaven or hell can the young black live
Or will he be chained in the cell
I don't know as for me I only trusted a few
I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do
They say theres chances for everybody thats bullshit
That little girl had no chance when that bullet hit
I mean it blew to the sky
And all you heard was a cry
Oh lord don't let my baby die
(chorus)
Til the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood
Fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would
Ain't shit changed like oh once said
And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead
Neither is Pook or Kansas City
True og's still here with me
My homie boo, boo what up
And you know I can't forget about my nigga nigga Novesnake
Nightime boats and herbie
Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me
I rock genue death so dam sensless
Big houses what the fucking radio been missing
And theres one more nigga that be true to my heart
Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking em off
So our
I peed em to dead
Whole reason was love
To that nigga twist for believing in me
I got a shorty to feed
My priority is to make sure this shit dont have to struggle like me
And if I could ask for one more wish
I tell em I wanna hug ya cuz I'm missing ya since
(chorus)
So I'm asking to pray for me
Mamma pray for me
Daddy pray for me
Baby pray for me
Please pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me

Crutch time a little pressure nigga I can't win the game in a clutch /
Niggas on the gram, flashing money looking like a stain gain to us /
Pull up with your main thing, nigga I just want a brain not a gut /
Then you can have the hoe back, play with me and get split like a cantaloupe /
We making hoes sick, I got the antidote, I be taking pictures whip it and dispense it on my lap /
Every time that I spit it I snap, they like the rhythm, they like the passion /
They like the talented rap, who fucking with me I'm winning that stat /
She let me hit it then neck, she gon' let my nigga smash that /
I ain't lie, I ain't got to stunt about shit, gang signs /
40 up under my shit, bang that, rim 40 all on my wrists /
My bitch got mad so I got her the same shit, now she's fine  /
Why the pussy niggas got a problem with me? Maybe cuz I fucked his hoe and he saw her with me /
Saw me when I pulled up and she hopped in the car with me, yeah she agreed to have a menage with me /

Pay in the middle of the fall, when I was aiming right at the middle of your head /
No choppers, no ARs (none of that), it was 25 calibers instead /
Feeling like everyday could be my last, shit I was on the mother fucking end /
Till one day I woke up, I was introduced to rapping, how to make bread /
By the time, Dre dropped that Chronic, it was  on the mood they way I spit /
Every time a nigga wake up, I was always on another lit /
And every night I lay down, I was always on another bitch /
That's why I'm  getting money right now, we get it in nigga hand over fist /

No L's no nothing, I was still driving, riding with a strap in the rental /
Getting to it with a nigga, pull up on him with it hanging like a window /

Should of play your cards right, nigga now you got your family in the middle /
Since sixteen, I was playing around with guns like a  /
Way before I really try to be a mc, I was squeezing them bitches till it was empty /
Way before they put the charges against me, I was into rap  /
In the basement starving, just me, with nobody else around it was just beats /
So I had to get it, I wanted some better living, fresh out of the kettle with it /
Been packing a metal with it, I'm hoping that that'll get it /
You make a better decision, I feel like the devil with it /
Stay the fuck out of my business, I feel like I'm handling it /
Scandalous, high of cannabis, rappers want to rap like this, they try to channel this /
This shit's easy to me, I dismantle it, I'm the catalyst, somebody tell em what time it is /
Hook
Pay in the middle of the fall, when I was aiming right at the middle of your head /
No choppers, no ARs (none of that), it was 25 calibers instead /
Feeling like everyday could be my last, shit I was on the mother fucking end /
Till one day I woke up, I was introduced to rapping, how to make bread /
By the time, Dre dropped that Chronic, it was  on the mood they way I spit /
Every time a nigga wake up, I was always on another lit /
And every night I lay down, I was always on another bitch /
That's why I'm  getting money right now, we get it in nigga hand over  /",https://genius.com/Twista-livin-legend-intro-lyrics

They call me Cocky Balboa, I'm rocky, come and look at how I glisten

How many colors you got in that watch? Black and white and blue and yellow
Hundred karats on the iPod, hundred karats on the Gucci link

Screamin' stop killin' for dollars
From G-I, from the South to the Westside
From the D-I and where I love, Darkside
I forever got my pride
Forever guide my guys to a better mindstate or phase
To replace all the wicked ideas erased
All the fears about the payroll
What you say Lo about Sko
We representin' the Chi, do or die for real
Niggas caps gettin' twist off they tops for real
The conflict's in the hearts of many men for real
The convicts in the Pen holdin' plenty steel
Niggas know they house bigger but they play in the field
Tabasco ain't gon' let it ride though
Let my brother fat folk
I thrill for the kill
Smoke me a ?
Never runnin' from the mill boy I'm runnin' the field
It's the eternal Lord feel cemeteries revealed
Prophecies prophetcized stuff bein' fulfilled
And to another man I'll never kneel
Until I see Allah, fate's comin' from the wheel
And baby girl, you can check it you can dig it here
If yo nigga try to test it, you can bet it he'll
Be in a grave he lay, he lay
In the grave he lay, he lay, he lay

It's Liffy Stokes with the sticky smoke
Quick to shoot a muthafucka down if he choke
Never see me in yo city broke
In the club spendin' 50 notes
Leave with 50 girls and 50 Folks
And we all tote scopes
Guarded like the Pope cause we got that bomb on the dope
G-stacks in our coat
Niggas ask, we ain't hoes
Just to afloat with me, I'm livin' lovely
Baby come on and relax with a Folk
All my mackateers know why we ride down
Cliqued-up pick the bitch up bumpin' sounds, hurtin' the whole town
With raw pound all around me ya dig, the sounds off like a live round
22's on Fleet, peep my shine now
I got a whole fuckin' nation that'll ride out
And put yo lights out in a matter of minutes young nigga
So it's best for you to be closin' yo fuckin' mouth
Before I pull out and bust slugs in yo ass
You lucky yo bitch here, that's why I'm givin' you a pass
Nigga haul ass before I up and blast with no mask
And blow off you bit of mustache with yo tough ass
Shit everybody's bustin' down
My niggas fallin' off all around
Before I go, I got my 50-rounds
To blaze a nigga before I hit the ground

It's really gettin' hot on the block
Niggas got they Glocks, niggas sellin' they rocks
But my mind prepared to get this muthafuckin' knot
So a nigga ain't scared to put a nigga in the box
If I gotta drop him down in the grave
In the grave he gon' lay-he
Cause this shit don't stop, I shut 'me down everyday
Everyday anyway he, anyway he
If he grown or not, wrong or not
Niggas better shake the spot and praise Allah
Don't let me see yo face nowhere by the peace Allah
A laundry mat, niggas better have they Glocks cocked off
Ready to blast off and get yo ass popped off
With 10 hot ones when I draw from ??? when I smash off over there
It's blood on the curb over there
And them niggas that be actin' like nerds over there
And my niggas that be flippin' plenty birds over there
For them niggas that be gettin' on my nerves over there
For my brothers that be gettin' plenty dirt over there
For them ?? broads with all that weave in they hair
Who ain't got no walls, pussy like bees in the air
She dropped them draws and then I zoomed outta there
Cause I got my laws, I'ma stay strong to myself
And I thought about y'all, that's why I ball by myself
I don't need no mob to make me feel like myself
I don't need no job, I'll make these G's by myself

Frum Da Tip Of My Tung,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992,"Droppin' a flow like this be breakin' the suckers
And rippin' the rhythm and showin' I'm bringin' the feel of my tongue
And be makin' 'em manifest that I be rockin' the young
Flowin' this style I be singin' and bringin'
It's breakin' the people and go in the mind of a teen
Be makin' 'em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
'Cause hip-hop is becomin' complicated, never be left hung
Bringin' a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over will be stung

How was the rhyme brung?
Frum the tip of my tung (x7)
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum among the tip of my tung

Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin' the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin', but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin' this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'mma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack 'cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin'
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
Flowin' this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by
When I'mma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee
Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T
Steppin' and then I'mma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee
Rockin' and me stylin', rockin' and me stylin', wildin'
Them say me tracks be wack, I just sip them like them coco
Loco, a lyrical thing I sling and cling like Sing-Sing, merciless like Ming
Watch me come and stiff in 'em like a photo
Funky, funky, funky stylin', wildin'
I'mma drop in a flow that breaks and takes a lyrical wiz to wax a funky scholar
Flowin' a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung
Breakin' 'em up in a snap, I think that I better thank Allah

How was the rhyme brung?
Frum the tip of my tung (x7)
How was the rhyme brung?
Frum among the tip of my tung

Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick
I throw in a blister of a body
Breaking 'em up so quick that I can even bruise hair
Rhythm will rock blocks and funky track drops
Don't wanna come in the door but when you're hearing
Do I hear a ""knock-knock who's there""?
Twista breaking 'em off in a magical rhythmous manifestation
Of a lyrical racing chasing suckers that my funky rhythm elects
Wrote this, quote this, notice how I wreck
My funky hocus pocus broke his neck

Recollecting the essence of that shit that I know you wanna hear
Go on especially if you smoke pimp, cmon and take a sip
Of the liquor of my life and get drunk of the way that the veteran get it in like he supposed to
Terrorising like the creature King Kong when it come to getting on the song, show em why they chose you
Spectacular when I be killing em off with the words, I murder the beat so they getting served like soft like
Off white let me show you how a baller dress, show how you how we ride, show you what a baller talk like
Some razzle dazzle with the words look at how he said
Make the ladies love it and they all say ""hey now""
Put a hurting on them from the way you kick it
And you do it so smooth

But the way you put it down
You don't mess around
You professional
You don't mess around 
You're dangerous
Pardon the intrusion, its the real peep script, check the style I done started the illusion
Of mastering me thats what other cats attending but this here is patent pending and still imma be improving
Stutter stepping, strutting, rocking to percussions, coming up with something just to show them niggas ""they ain't fucking with me""
Up on a pedestal kind of extravagant when I be bringing it, by the remarkable amount of haters if they want me come and get me
But don't judge me, cause i'm so strong. Let he who without sin cast the first stone
Cause imma simply pull a ho card and flow on, cause somebody told me to ""go hard or go home""
New Twista on the legendary trax beat, fresh for everybody, angel dust
Like what you get when you cross Michael Jackson with Teddy Riley, dangerous

Under my office desk imma get my dick sucked, bossed out, flossed out, flicked up
Then I throw my wrist up, get her tossed out, light up a cigar, lean back, feet kicked up
Or get in it like I'm an entrepreneur, connoisseur, it's a mantra but still I honour to do her
So I maneuver, she rode it and put on a hell of a performance don't even bother to boo her
Then when i go up in the party, i be cocky, cause lil mama thick and them bitches looking hella pathetic
Pull up in a Benz or probably Maserati and they undress her with they eyes like they telekinetic
Niggas looking at her hard so they all stutter
And bitches wishing they could take her clothes off of her

Steady stackin' G's, I'm been givin' you too much cheese to leave

I done took the bottle with Don, and I'm back for sure
Actin' a fool, gettin' skully, mixin' henny and mo
With plenty to draw, and we gotta blaze by the door
With too much M to the O from rushin' the dance floor
Mob style runnin' wild through every section and aisle
Drinkin' River, pissy now, collectin' numbers to dial
Talkin' loud, flash the cheese just for the haters and keys
That try to catch me sooner so they can cease without the cheese
Through mobstability, y'all be killin' me
With that weak shit, a nigga just came to party
With my guys and women probably pitchin' couple of innings
Break em down through my winnings and come out Detroit grinnin
With my paper and ladies on the E doin' about eighty
Tryin' to get to the (?) so that freaky bitch can lay me

When the mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
The mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with

I'm bendin' curves through the gym straight smokin' and drinkin'
Westside, mob style, and the mink and the lickin'
Trippin' on the cutie that's winkin'
Cause she know we got the shit that rocks her block
And put the boom in your box and make your speakers pop
So I take this as my cue to make sure shorty don't snooze
The mobsta's rockin' tonight at the House of Blues
With some mo and some crews and now she lookin' in dues
Talkin' about bringin' our homies and puttin' on dancin' shoes
It's like that y'all, let your paper stack tall
So when you hit the club you can ball and get some numbers to call
Don't worry about the playa haters leanin' on the wall
Because when they get the gold and start to ball
They gonna have to fight us all to the end
Playas get a glass and a set of twins
In different clothes so they can be a thug's extend
Cause when this party ends another begins it don't stop
So flash your knot and beep me at my guy's red shop


Hey hey, oh suki-suki now, look here now, what's cookin' now
Shook it shook it, child, shake it down, let's boogie now
From the hood and I be the chief, feelin' good as taters and waiters
With playas with the ladies pullin' up in big-ridin' Mercedes
This party gon' fade me, smokin' with the brokes and the brothers
Cherry gators, yo dawg, this pocket's full hundreds and rollers
I'm kickin' it out with tippin' dippin' off from the laws
In the glance of an eye with drawers, while they hustlin' just to ball
(?) so I bought a drink, sport a link, recall the mink
Ho figure she was pretty and think maybe I ought to wink
And she takes a glance, party'a boomin' so maybe I got a chance
This cutie got too much booty and I asked her to dance
Flippin' 50s in my hand, champagne all up in my face

Thought I was put here to honor those that had somethin'

How can I be so young realizin' life is hard?""
Seein' so much pain and hunger grow up from a adolescence
Realizin' that I never had a blessin'
And look at momma
Wasn't like God had her life cut off
I see her cryin', prayin' night 'cause the lights cut off
My comin' of age, poor even though we government paid
Hard times 'cause we came up off of public aid
And, shit, didn't drive 'til I was twenty
But didn't know we had somethin' even though we didn't have money
Lovin', it is the truth
Strong family roots
You can make if you work hard and pray it, I'm livin' proof
Don't be tellin' me to get well or to rest in peace
I thank the Creator for bringin' out the best in me
He blesses me

I'm blessed and that's okay
He's takin' care of me
And I'm thankful for each day
'Cause I know He blesses me
When the new day unite
As hard as it may be
I'm thankful 'cause I know-I know He blesses me

Always to Allah, take some righteous advice
You could to Jehovah or get some Christ in your life
Whatever your belief, just know that God is in you
Have a little faith in yourself and you could do what you do
Get a job, get some ends, get a Bentley, get a Benz
Get some ice, get a , give a blessin' to a friend
Sit back and watch it come back to you ten times fold
I thank the Lord for my ability to spit rhymes cold
I know you got some static but, shorty, put down the gun
Keep the faith and study up on the mother, child, and the son
I got a rifle but my life and career's revival came when my grandma said, ""Put a letter up in the Bible""
That I wrote to God, it should be no man's shame
'Cause I got my life together, that's when Slow Jamz came
Dropped a album, Kamikaze, and did away with the stress
When you lay that triple platinum, can't you tell I'm a success?
I've been blessed

I'm blessed and that's okay
He's takin' care of me
And I'm thankful for each day
'Cause I know He blesses me
When the new day unite
As hard as it may be
I'm thankful 'cause I know-I know He blesses me

I thank the Lord
 for the air that I breathe
I thank the Lord
 for bringin' blessings to my seed
I thank the Lord
 for fillin' all of my needs
I thank the Lord
 you better get down on your knees
I thank the Lord
 for my family and they health
I thank the Lord
 for all the money and the wealth
I thank the Lord

You gon' have to move man, twenty-thousand a week, and I ain't hear nothin'
Bust at y'all and stackin' chips on the seat, if police come cuffin'
That's when I might have to hide out
Or dip through the hood wit' the chrome and the wood
When I pull that ride out, got a screen that slide out
When I jump out, boys gone (I'm out'chea)
If you wanna get them rocks and them blows (I'm out'chea)
If you plottin' on a mission to get me (I'm out'chea)

State Prop Chain gang, get low
It's the Roc, building, nigga
Yeah, it's the motherfuckin' Roc, bitch
Who hotter than us? Okay, okay
Young Chris
Ayo, ever since a Young Buck, I been on the come up
Known to dish the raw, dish the law if they come up
Get cheddar 'till the sun up, if there's a ransom
And the law get involved then we never give their son up
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me
I go to war wit' niggas 'round the corner from 'round me
You could front 'round me but I read through that
Wit' the mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Sigel Mac
Niggas, see, shoot back, we can see to that
Hit yo front, let it seep through back, bring yo peoples back
And I used to grind out on my friend's spot
'Til his mom wanted my Tim box
Now my paint got me discounts
Or trans quo all around the world, like I was signed to Pimp-dot
And if it's ten targets and I got ten shots
I'm tryin' to leave at least nine out of them ten shot
Memphis Bleek
I got my mind on my money, money on mind
But some say, it's a gift, I don't write but I rhyme
I complete songs with just one try
Tell 'em it's no lie, I be flowin' my life, dogg
I never think, it's already there
I find ways to say it so you motherfuckers hear
And when you hear it, you feel it, you know it's real so
This is how I live it, how it's pitchin' for real, nigga
I'm shittin' for real
Diamonds against wood, underground king for real
Big crib when I lay, yeah, I'm livin' for real
Trust me, the guns come off the shelf whenever shit'll get real
Automatics and extended clips that's what I'm hittin' wit'
Dummies in the black rhinos, yeah, they be killin' shit
Masked up kidnap shit that's how my niggas get
Chi-town, NYC that's how my niggas get
Freeway
It's Young Free in the flesh
Yes, just picture me rollin'
The Smith and Wesson'll stay goin' put a hole in yo chest
It's just another hustle paper gettin' made and folded
Get mad, you street niggas finally made it
I swoop five, he know to ride, heavily loaded
Deliver pies like cake, they go straight through yo payment
Chump, you don't really wanna war
With the State Prop clique, if ya clique shot up, squad up
S-P game so damn tough, the 4 4 in the 5th tucked y'all can't hang
Transporter turned rapper, get a camcorder, film my life
Still accomplished, tryin' to fill they cups
The rap version of Mandela, call my bluff
We still the street dwellers, feel my pain
I spit a verse and split a clip in the rain
A fool proof when the full force open you up
Twista
Twista will rock you, you don't want the thug Apostle to pop you
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossils
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits
For real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of Porches
Hit 'em in the body wit' the powerful forces
That'll end all your doubt, make you clean up your house
Bag up an ounce, hit the dance floor and bounce
We blessed wit' the talent, fuck wit this clique
It ain't gon' be easy 'cause you fuckin' wit' Twist
If you fuck wit Chris, Bleek and Free-wheezy
So speak and breath easy or the scutches my future in 3D
I like wars, I'm from a city full of Vice Lords and GD's
Breeds and Souls, 2-6's, Kings, BD's and Stones
Spanish Cobras and all the true soldiers, survive and I'm gone
Watch me spit if for the killers and hustler's
Flippin' all the pounds and bricks
Hate on me, I'ma bust at you hoes

Me And You,Dark Horse,2014,"Look at the plush, truck, women'll blush
Especially when I bust ""Adrenaline Rush"", crush, pennin from us
Venomous flowin is hard, look at the ice, oh, look at the walk
In the presence of a god, see how he thinks, oh, look how he talks
And I'ma come with the style, most of 'em like, then, most of 'em bite
Whether they go write it down, or spit it in, they, mobil device
Niggas could never compete, they lesser than me, I'm, destined to be
Run the Midwest and the reason the lesson'll be, one of the best in the streets
Takin a lesson from me cause I'm wreckin the beat, a molecular special MC
If you wanna take it and be, with knowledge of self, there's no better weapon than me
And I hope you got the kush, gimme the woods, cause, I gotta smoke
And if you don't got the dough, then it'll be, adios, I gotta go
Unless you got somethin to say, look at the time, no, look at the mind
Don't think about what I'ma do if it ain't about money or you don't say nothin divine
I'm loving that you in the way, I wanna get, that, power and guap
Remember I used to get break, now I don't sleep, nope, now I don't stop

I do it for me and you
They wanna know why do I work work (c'mon)
Why do I smoke? So I could be turnt turnt (c'mon)
Why do I grind? So we can floss floss (c'mon)
And why do I shine? Because I'm a boss boss
I do it for me and you... c'mon
I do it for me and you... c'mon

I want you to visualize and just, look at the stage, look at the bright lights
C'mon; look at the rage, look at the night life
Listen to a dope individual, not one of them niggas who flowin so pitiful
Hopin to get with you so when you payin' attention your focus is critical
Snappin like a Kodak'll be, hope you get the picture, now Twista you notice I beast
Don't flow after me, I'll eat 'em up and then say ""Bon appétit""
And it'll be so depressin if I talk about everything that bother me
Millionaires livin in the same country as people in poverty
So fuck you and your opinion, I'm on my own dominion
Street scriptures, hieroglyphics that ain't the book of the Gideons
An infinite era I'm in, travellin through a multiverse
Keepin it smooth, I tell a motherfucker come insult me first
Can I get ahead of us and I can see you be scared of us
And you be talkin et cetera, et cetera, but everybody'll know what you spit is a replica
Of what I do so I'ma just stay hot
And I be makin the cash, and when she ask why I'm away a lot",https://genius.com/Twista-me-and-you-lyrics

Mobsta elite's back up in this muthafuck 'em (Bitch)
And we airin' out all you playa-hatin-lame-ass niggas
And we on this laid-back track, something smooth
Eh yo, Mayz, whatcha don' do, kick it

And ride on, niggas get your high on
While we pump this shit to vibe on
The muthafuckin' mobsta elite'll leave you breathless
When we hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the Chevy Caprice
I'm hurtin', so I'm thinkin of ways to gettin' paid
Cheddar in a bundle, fifties and hundreds and G stacks
If I could just hit that big lick I could relax
And ease back off of thuggin' and stick to hustlin'
Concentrate on paper and let the shorties do the bustin'
While I motivate on power moves, you live be coward rules
Singing the blues while I pack shit that'll knock you out your shoes
Cause I'm a fool playing the game of the streets
Claiming elites, making sure my family eats
We roll and it flees, bunkin' niggas out of their seats
While mobbin' on beats, soon niggas can't back down or retreat
Preventing mine, just doing petty crimes, I'm not petty or nice
Standin' in line, calmly waitin' on my time to shine
Cause when I shine, I'mma glisten
As all the heads come up missing
I'mma slide in and assume the position
My mom's stick thick, who the killas and convicts
Bulletproof now, pistol holsters under the arm pits
Ready to go out in the blaze of glory
Standin' firm on the deck makin' the front-page story

When your mobs' at your side and they're ready to ride, nigga
(Nigga, that's mobstability)
And when you go from movin' O's to keys for more cheese
(Fool, that's mobstability)
And when it's money over bitches cause you're stackin' your riches
(Playa, that's mobstability)
Gettin' your mind right for payin' for the year 2G
(Gotsta be mobstability)

I heard a raw beat, somebody told me the funk did it
But if Trax didn't do it I can't fuck it
Cause it's a family thang
You know Chi-Town's the motherland of the wild
The chain of mobsters and gangs
But we're the elite few that just can't be contained
Tippin' only the plane, determine it's about the game
Like a playa stays the same, ain't tryin' to act strange to change
Cause the more paper you got, the more you got to slang
And there's more haters to bang cause they all want a piece
You got to be slick as grease cause they want the playas deceased
Restin' in peace
But my motto's simply too tight for you to threaten my life
With a knife, gun or mic
You don't really wanna fight so just swallow your pride
Before I come inside your crib and kidnap the shorty and bride
Every nigga alive wish he had a psycho status
Will your punks ready to ride so the bitches can come at us
In the city of thugs, police, politicians and drugs
If they ain't passin' the bubble, niggas carry a grudge, but no love
So I don't give a muthafuck if you killin' me
I'm pissin' out headshots, protestin' my mobstability


If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right
So I circle the block strapped
Watching the workers while they circle muthafuckas at night
They work to tippin' me cause dope fiends ain't wangers
These wanches are skanches, this ain't just how the cracks and hiatus
My crew react tamers than sweat hogs, to protect that (?) bomb
But no teflon, your flesh was tearin', for the love of this heron
I bare arms and I'm quick to snatch cards to those who react hard
Don't judge these, got you robbed, I'mma get more cheddar for my black mob
My legion is broke down into sections to run every regions
Slugs and thugs, rifles for rifles cause we walk every season
Having shootin' apartments, cars with hidden compartments for po-pos
Zip polos holding pistolos and mobstas know those
Sooner then booted, looted then zooted, (?) shoes so can I
Automatics but semi, then I, watches your midnight
Cause I be handlin' my function when the nine-milliter get to jumpin'
Dumpin' on niggas who claimin' my muthafuckas ain't worth for nothin'
I'm bustin', how's game I peep when I was a shorty
Having big dreams on money, cars and bitches by the time I reach forty
Nation affiliation, dummy paper-chase and willin'
For pay probabilities only seen through mobtability, feelin' me",https://genius.com/Twista-mobstability-lyrics

When they look at the medallion and the stallion they gon know he for real
Haters ain't gon know what to do
Bitches looking out at my coupe
Riders with me ready to shoot
Smoking nothing but the best in the booth
They serve it to me like I'm in a delicatessen
To the chest and I'mma hit it right
Now that's a blessing how I dress it's just a lesson just so they can get it right

I'm like Dracula with this, my vernacular's endless
Ask if it's fact or fictitious, but it's just the act of a menace..
Nigga this far from scary and I'm like a barbarian
Arian, air he inhalin' until I start to airin' 'em
So don't even start comparin' em, or I'mma just start to bury 'em
I'm darin' 'em, to come take a swim in the shark's aquarium
Lyric extortionist, turn you to carcasses, every portion is
Thoughts of a awkward vocal contortionist..
On my mom and them I'm better than them who copy my flow like a homonym..
And Amoxicillin will not stop the villain, it's pain I inflict when I'm bombin' 'em
God like I'm Andromedan, better yet Osiris or should I just say Asaar
Father of Heru, I told you that I was astonishing
Take a walk in my moccasin, I can send you through a journey of knowledge and horror
Sodom and Gomorrah, biblical verses as if I was reading the Torah
(Shawnna Verse)
Bastards and Bitches, after my riches
But I count my stacks and my digits like I was 10 mathematicians
You gon' slice your wristiphon, tights that go glistenin
Do what I can maestro with the brightest like nitroglycerin
My oral skill is a horrible chlorophyll
Hallucinogenic that you get so dumb like cannabis or a pill
Shawnna can do shit that be damagin'
Leavin' 'em standin' stiff as a mannequin
Burn a bitch up cause I'm hot
Pain I inflict cannot ever be cured with no Anacin
Rhetoric that I spit is like magic cause I am a sorcerer conjuring fortresses leaving the floor full of carcasses
Motherfuckers should fall for this
On the core with this, I am a beast, a hottie, bangin
Bodies with niggas
My hobby is triggas, so don't make me have to
Come up and shotty your nigga",https://genius.com/Twista-bastards-and-bitches-lyrics
Mob Niggas Dont Die,Legit Ballin Vol. 2,2001,"Gang Bangin ain't go' never die, as long
As niggas ain't got nothing we go' be thuggin forever high
Ain't no more drive by's, niggas chase you down til they get you
Multiple slugz found in your tissue
Whatever it is you should've honored it
When them niggas told you not to come around here
And you was found here
Your death is now near
I'm bout to put a bullet in his gut, catch him at the stop sign
And dump em' in his nuts. Now lets play a game of find and search
While your mamma cryin' in church
I'll be spyin for work
I'mma go right on
Cause when your life's gone
Nigga there is no replacement
And you got your work hid in the basement
I got it, gothic
Go for the endo, she's smokin hydro-ponic chronic
Blow out the heart like entity injuries upon my body
Don't help heal up the scar, so baby don't cry
Cause mob niggas don't die

Mob niggas ain't go' never die
We in the lot, callin shots, keeping
Dope fiends forever high
Forever fire get lit wit the trigger eye
Twenty split, gun the bitch, leave her dead I
Man I put your block on four
Hit k town and come back wit a bus load
Full of niggas that's down and dirty, pushin thirty
Minutes beef it gets muddy
But I'mma swim through the murky water
Hold it down like a carter, live long like a godfather
Kick Volvo's, fuck tight hoes
Live a life many kill and fight for
And campaign in this rap game, cause ain't nothing out
Here in these motherfucking
Streets man, and that's comin from a nigga you know who chose
To be legit and still rip foes

Mob niggas, cause drama, till it's hot
Get shot, see the dot
Same day back on the block, set up shop
Hat throw thuggin, throwin up
Fo's and forks, strapped up
Screamin out I ain't gon' never die

We can be shot at, battered and bruised
Bloody and left out in the cold
But real niggas never fall, if I'm a hundred years old
I'm still gonna murder you
Cause mob niggas don't die

Real elites don't die
We just close are eyes and open fire
Mash and bang on niggas let them hot ones fly
You can tell a maniac by the look in his eye, carbine two
Magazines and a throw away nine
My positions to work opposition
Competition is minimum blocks
We bendin 'em shots
We sendin 'em I let the rhythm
Hit em put venom in em
Bloody up the denim in his jeans
And watch the white shirt study the scene
I mean, Gang bangin ain't gone Never cease
As long as it's streets, police and heat, dope rocks and weed
Chronic, empty stomachs and mouths to feed
Who want it niggas off the Dee
To K Town we spray rounds
So stay down, this ain't no play ground around here
You could get found around here
Shot up, battered and bruised
Headline of the news
The chosen, the few, mob niggas don't die fool
Chorus 1 *2
Chorus 2 *2

Hey, my papa told me, boy if, you wanna be a G
You gots, to flip them keys
And avoid, them federalies
Cause they, be on that ass
Ready to blast fast
Nigga fuck ask they take it, an' I'm shakin' off
Charges like Payton
Hot stepping out the courtroom in gators, true playaz
No the business
No case without a witness, its senseless to resist this
Hostile take over
To late to pray to Jehovah, death closer, I lit him up like a toaster
Then put my shit back in my holsta
Blood crumbled on the posters
I gave a foe like a nigga was supposed ta

Shit, was wit the bogus bird, I don't want it
I can tell when I rub my finger across it it got sumthin on it
Fuck it if you niggas wanna get killed wit a chick in the coat
Cause you can die wit the dick in the throat, hittin the dro
Back on the block servin
After the murder packin
For work cuz we're lucky popo's ain't havin 'em nervous
Think what I was in, family show up, an' the enemy
They lay, got it locked wit ten rolls
If they spray, fuck it
I'mma come back in the buck n'bloody fractures on my body
Bustin out on the public, bringin' the ruckus
Screamin, die punk motherfuckers
Reminice on how them hoes put the nigga on crutches
Smokin' on dutches, fifty sack in my clutches
Ballin no flows go, hataz Askin' how the mob's so strong
I belong to the breathin' niggas that wanna take over after pop
Label me the verbal aftershock
I'mma never die!",https://genius.com/Twista-mob-niggas-dont-die-lyrics
D.O.A.,Dark Horse,2014,"Dead on arrival, swear to God I'mma kill 'em
As if I done put my hands on the Bible
Get 'em cause I'm liable to rock a motherfucker off
Especially if I get my hands on a rifle
Do the damn thang, not that they can stop a nigga
Pop a nigga off as if you were champagne
Put 'em in the ambulance but ain't no resuscitation
Cause he done got knocked off, point-blank range
It's a crisis the way niggas will pull up and shoot
Last week, the streets just put him in a coupe
This week, the streets just put him in a suit
Six feet under with dirt on top of the roof
Put 'em in a grave, people standin' over your body
And they wonderin' if your soul'll be saved
Or if it has risen or if it will be forbidden, by the way
You was doin' shit, they could've put you in prison
Now you ain't with the livin'
Cause you weren't a shooter or didn't know how to shoot
Either way feel inferior, I make the block cripple
Comin' like a moshpit'll be the nigga knowin' if we
Bustin' Glocks, it'll put you up in a hospital
And when you on the way
And they get a look at the way that the bullets spray
Everybody about to know, that we don't play
Makin' sure that your body arrive D.O.A
Or dead on arrival...

Dead on arrival, soul all up on the block
I put some shots up in the head of a rival
Gun up on the passenger side of the vehicle, he hit you
With the artillery simply cause he didn't like you
Should've knew not to piss him off
Catch a disease of a gun cause it'll cough
Better watch your mouth if you see some grown folks
About higher pedigree, especially if it be a boss
These lil' niggas ain't playin'
Soon as you come up and start talkin' shit, then they sprayin'

Soon as they see the nigga hit, then they ran
Straight got ghost, they don't wanna  a nigga
That comin' at 'em ambitiously with the toast
Point-blank range if you let 'em too close
Scene of a homicide, body was lookin' gross
Prob'ly off with your head, if him in the scene
Was comin' to the war cryin' soft like 
And this ain't no Walking Dead, they get rid of you
If they dumped a body and a white chump might talk
No talkin' to the Feds,  they hit 'em fast
Try to retaliate, but they gon' get his ass
And they ain't gon' be able to revive him in the ambulance
They just gon' pick him up and zip him in a bag
Dead on arrival",https://genius.com/Twista-doa-lyrics

Extremely hard to be the king of a city it's dis
A nigga that could twist like this
A nigga that could rip any shit that he get
Never balk and come with a metaphor like this
Flow like dis, never broke but flow for the dough like this
Never been a nigga that you know like dis
Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis
Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checking for us
Never catch us catching the bus
Niggas got whips, niggas got loot
Niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what)
Next big thing, iced watch to go with the necklace ring
Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is going against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up
Rhyme till I can't rhyme no more, ball till I can't ball no more
Till I'm 5'9"" no more, till the ice can't shine no more
Which ever comes first, let's go nigga

Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willing to pin ya in rap
Put a ending to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sending you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm
This my shit, keep every word of every verse in position to launch
Never gon' fail, never got plans of catching a L
I'ma forever prevail, whatever you yell
It's my world, everything else, c'mon nigga

Cause homie you ain't got no choice ta
That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers
We coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride
And hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off
And coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts
But if yo' operation is hating, who the fuck want what?

Hustla,Category F5,2009,"Chorus
Break it down slow, Take it down ohh
Said I'm a hustla by any means boy I don't play
If they don't give me what I wants I goes the other way
I'm ridin dirty, dirty im ridin swore to god I'ma ball each day
So come prepared I ain't neva scared they gone let my sources bank
Yea!
Twista
I got whatever you want I got whatever you need I'm a hustla from the Chi I can flip that
Billion dolla niggas with the billion dolla looks when them niggas got kush in the Midwest
Used to be able to come up off it
Used to be able to get the elbow for the 6 now mother fuckers want 8 (shit)
I'm supposed to honor the number but I know a nigga who a killa who don't give a damn might just
Come at you for the connect or I'ma have to do you in cause you chargin me middle man prices
I remember when we used to break a bitch now it's a recession we got to wait for the lick
For the kush they want 6 for the ounce (what?), and they want 28 for the brick
Now how the fuck am I gonna get rid of these them two I'm hopin them go soon
Dude said he can't cop em I want too much and I ain't leavin him no room
I gotta get it how I gotta get it even if I'm breakin down (dope) Break it down (slow) Take it down (oh)

Rollin with a pistol and a double aluminum room at the Ramada getting down in the streets
Hustlin hard takin what you can get , but you steady reminiscing on 50,000 a week
A playa mode is about how to look good and different methods on how to cut that hoe
Hustle mode is if the cocaine cook good and different methods on how to cut that dough
Had to pop at a nigga because it used to be cool you trusted him and now you gotta go to court
Cause he gave you the money and when he drove off he called you and told you he was short
That's some shit that could've got dude killed listen to it when the rap tunes real
Put the bitch on the plane with a couple of pounds that you can't smell cause its vaccum sealed
Take off a quarter then smoke in order they choke I cut it open they collapse from the scent
Pop it all off for 600 an ounce I'm get to smoke for free and get back what I spent
I gotta get it how I gotta get it even if I?m breakin down (dope) Break it down (slow) Take it down (oh)
Chorus
Said I'm a hustla by any means boy I don't play

Uh - it's the Twista, I'm back to work, when you see me talkin shit I get to act berserk
Treat a bitch like a nigga then smack her first then treat a nigga like a bitch and then snatch her purse
Ah, I still do it, listen to the beat and blow kill to it
Come up with some shit that make a nigga act up and a bitch wanna pop that pill to it
Chi-Town get buck, so don't fuck with them cause they will do it
Them VD's and Stones'll put it straight in your dome, I know conservatives'll make real fluid
Niggas yellin ""Almighty boy,"" hammer cocked back like The Mighty Thor
(Avengin) the death of a night before, like the gangstas'll do when they ignitin war
And the Windy City dreadheads, spray up your house and leave your bed red
Lay out your casket with your bedspread and leavin everybody fuckin with the Greg dead
Cause I cain't go; codeine, swag, cocaine flow
Feelin better when everything is in slow-mo, cheddar with a methamphetamine, no joke
Uh - gotta let you know boy, for the beef dope must be the antidote boy
I wear my gold like a pimp do, and I got the low-key demeanor of a coke boy
And my - swagger like a dope boy (swagger like a dope boy)...

You feel like you better cause you makin' cheddar Instead of realizin' the one that you might of cut off could go through an endeavor
Fluent as ever in my thing and I keep it real
I know they be hatin' and trippin' so I keep the steel
I know that the devil is coming so I keep a shield
Don't wanna go out of my mind so I keep the kill
Why are you saying that you could not ever be broke?
Why are you saying that there could not ever be hope?
Why are you saying that you can not get what you wanna get when I be making that money from flowin' on heavenly notes
Chorus:
What am I to do? (What am I to do y'all?)
My mind is in a whirlpool (Man Im going crazy)
Give me a little hope (I need hope)
One small thing to cling to, yeah
Neva, neva, neva
Verse 2:
Never let the haters say that you ain't up to par
Never should you be believin' you are not a star
Never should you ever think that you can't get that far
Never should you ever think that you can't get that car
Never be thinkin' the shit you be doin' will come back around and bite you in the ass, especially if you on woppy (??)
And when you be flowin' then never be using the words I be using if you rappin' fast especially if you gon' copy
But that be the reason when I flow I gotta switch it up
Cause I gotta give it to 'em in a way they wont pick it up
But never say never cause when they get the acappella theres somebody gon' do it better but until then give it up
So never say that you can't win if they say you gon lose
And never think you can come up if you dont make a move
And never believe that you are below anybody because of yo' looks
You are the shit, as long as you choose
Chorus:
What am I to do? (I don't know)
My mind is in a whirlpool (Know I'm talk'n 'bout?)
Give me a little hope (Yeah)
One small thing to cling to, yeah
Neva, neva, neva
Verse 3 (Twista):
I see hard crime, a child was runnin' around in the streets
And got caught in a murder now he aint gon' never come home
Never be thinkin' you helpin' by doin' whatever they want
Cause life is hard and he ain't gon' never be strong
Never believe that the the only way you can stop it
When you take a look at the drama
Please take a look at the lama
Now what you gon' do when you have to look at your Mama?
Now you can do better than that homie, look at Obama
And then sit, in the back, of the bus, if they dont, give it up
On the way, to the joint, cause you, think you can come up
You feelin' like you was invincible until they struck
With the right to remain silent, fuck
Never think that youre so hard that you cant get crossed
And never think that youre so hard that you cant get soft
And never think that youre so smart that you cant get taught
And never think that youre so smart that you cant get caught
Neva, neva, neva, oooooooooooh (Sing it, baby!)
Aaaaaaay (Tell em girl)
What am I to do?
My mind is in a whirlpool (feel me?)
What am I to do? (Tell 'em)
My mind is in a whirlpool (Know I'm talk'n 'bout?)
What am I to do?
My mind is in a whirlpool (Uh)
Give me a little hope, (Thats all I need)
One small thing to cling to
Outro:
(Oooooooh) Never say never, y'all already know the real, Y'all shawties gon' understand some day (Aaaaaaaaaay)
Gotta live for today, fight for tomorrow
(Neva, neva, neva, oooooooh, aaaaaaaaaaaay,)",https://genius.com/Twista-neva-neva-lyrics
Money Flow,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now for some typical reason
I'm rollin up some hoes and pattin my back seat hah
My pimpin lyrical tactics is like a dirty kid flippin on a mattress
Now flex this
Verse One: Tung Twista
Now I just be
On the front porch with a torch ready to scorch
Two women peepin me cause really I'm gone
In the zone they havin thoughts of freakin me
Keepin me company bumpin me for the privacy I'm on
They can see I'm a cool muhfucka kickin the petty
Down with a tango on my razor fade
Peanut butter complexion to silly processions
Of bitties a fifty sack got some reefers and a razor blade
Like a game of Spades, crack the bullshit
These days was made for me to devise strictly games that paid
Women freakin me greedy lickin me doin body graffiti
Throwin they panties up on the stage, are you up on the age?
Two players in the Chi, you're thinkin Do Or Die
You and I can be naked cause I'm the love that you've been thinkin of
The style of flow is a vocal calico
To show you with the mic I be speakin love, what's the words, weak and
Numb
Go to my crib, no need to bring a mask and Glock
Try not to pass the block, gettin more hot than the astronauts
Sippin After Shock
I ball cause I see you all on Rap-a-Lot
Let's get parley and then crack the spot
Plenty Henny for my crew and I ain't even broke up half a knot
Keep on holdin me while I roll to be we can smoke or ride
And you can play with me to keep the passion hot
Don't you know how the money flow
Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Verse Two: Belo
Mmmm, now they peep a brother Rolex
Try and get race car, heavy on the skin tech
Money clean like Windex
Givin up the ave like a brother gonna pass, but the hoe check
Hoe flex I'm on the avenue, lay it back sip a half a brew
So I see if I can have a fruit
A peep show like the hoe when she thinkin bout me havin you
She laughin too, and pass a few, beads around
Smokin trees till the leaves come down
She be clothed ain't a skeezer now, show em the paper
That be caught up at your crib with your pantses down
But money maker want a triple take
Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight
See him ridin in the see-A, D-I, double-L, A-see
Always checkin paper in tall ways
Pull em off the sprawlways
Herd a couple hoes in clothes and I'm supposed to be all day
Parley parley, dog that's how the money flow
Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
Don't you know
Verse Three: AK-47
Bend the block with the indo, blowin out my window
Rolex on my side do', lean back in the slow flow
Gettin paid as the night go
I see some fly hoe, tell me where you crib at
Where's the place that you live at?
Hit you on the phone till you be all alone
So we can get it on baby just kick back
Swiggin brews and Perrier
Thick chick with a booty like a plizayer do
AK (to where) to the pen
And to tell all my niggas to keep it strong
They ain't got long (to what) to see
Where the niggas is kick it where a nigga kick it
Go where I go Cadillac to the show
Po Pimp fuck the dough hit the stage and become wicked
Get the money and ride out, go back to the hideout
Take a woman to the bed and spread them thighs out
I'ma pull my surprise out
Then my boys was flyin out, but two girls were chasin
Deep in Chicago, been doin this since the nine-oh
Comin up put a number on fryin hoes
Let the money flow
Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
Verse Four: Nard
Now for some typical reason I'm rollin up with a hoe
And I'm pattin my back seat
I pimp lyrical tactics like a dirty kid flippin on a mat
Never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit
Then be dip through the Chi and enjoy my Lexus
Better blow when you bob your head, to the fed shit
Why you waitin for the next kid, motherfucker
Makin money just wanted to take a little get the dick wet
Get my girl in bed
Spend my money in the Southern, motherfuckers
That's thuggerin, but I'ma come from the heart for start
To stop all the niggas the bigger the trigger the larger the dividends
Pimpin and paperin leavin sugar in
Till money flow like a dreamland
But really though, could you tell me how the money flow?

Razzamatazz/Jazzamatazz,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992,"Oh - back again makin the rhythm kick jazz
Used to be wick-wack, now I got funky pizzazz
Idryss'll do my fade-up cause he cuts em like class
And the chicks want me to lick cause I'm too quick, I think I'll pass
Dollars, if I don't fold em, I roll em like a bolo
Other steppin to brothers cause he be God? Oh no
G-o-d, I be not he, it's true, don't call me loco
And my man Eric the Wiz will stir the mini mix up like Coco
Cut like Michael Myers, start up fires, I'm a scar hard
Thinkin I be wimpy, I just simply rip em far apart
Ansaars in New York, I know that you know that you are God
This brother's from Chicago, so I guess I'm a Chigagod
Rhythm is my producer of rhythms on the wax
The posse Lower Level be kickin some funky tracks
Never ask, I ax, I get madder than Max
Diggem smacks, if they try to tax I play em like a sax

Rock - me call it what?
(Razzamatazz)
Rock - me call it what?
(Jazzamatazz)

Styles, I hand em, I brand em like cattlecakes
Better get flows from your bros if a battle takes
I hear a hiss, the tale of a taddle shakes
Backs this breaks givin aches to the rattlesnakes
I get spunky with funky stylin
Rhythms I flow, I kick them wild and
Tryin to get with the styles I'm pilin
For your sob story I better get the violin
Come again - watch a fun one construct
I don't like sissy chickens and I hate a sucker duck
Some label me a sucker because ducks I like t pluck
The only way I be a sucker is if women wanna suck
Always goin broke so I don't dig into my stash
I'm cool as Brian Robbins on the show _Head of the Class_
If you don't get the picture, make the camera go flash
When this rhythm was a baby, doc spanked him on his - jaz


Study my culture, soar like a vulture
My teacher Marvin Howard will create my sculpture
I'm kickin Islam, some brothers try to bomb
Facts can harm but I still say Salaam
Sometimes I blush, bust and leave puss
Hush if I must, plus I don't forget to flush
With suckers I fuss, thought I was soft like a slush
Chicagods crush cause they think toys r us
Hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
Is funky hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
'll make a drip (drip what) drop
I like to rip (rip what) shop
I always slip (slip what) cops
Reachin the tip (tip what) top
Come in again

No Peace Sign,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992,"Relaxin', maxin' to the maximum
To tracks a hum, the wicks where the stacks are from
Inside the styles of a funky lyrical wiz
What a miracle is, get down to spiritual business
Now my tounge kissed
Put words in your system, wished 'em
Respect the blackness 'em
Give in them, win them, the peace they want
But don't want the peace sign unless it's in the mind
Become a victim because I kick them, sick them
Supposed to be black but they be wack
Those who pretend to be a muslim - I gooshed 'em
Positive ones - I pushed 'em
Into the path of righteousness, might get dissed
Those who pump a fist but ain't right with this
I increase rhymes wacks and weak minds
If it ain't real stop throwin' up peace signs

Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart

Terror wished 'em, I'ma terrorize elorize in disguise
Those false sabotagin' and I begin
To creepin' seepin' thought out unrighteousness and dissed
Connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness
Figured they manifestin' G I can address
Individually each MC is throwin' up peace but don't pray to the east
I recollect the soul should be playin' towards Mecca
But snakes and devils won't let you
Freestyle some religous free dump see
To let you know how come dumb some be
Ignorance a commence to look like a fish
And since we whipped from bars to a ghetto pris
I'ma wiz some brains I give 'em a brain washin'
When I'm walkin' devils I'm squashin'
Science fiction mixed in, tricks in, fixin'
The ways of all sort for good
Come in my fortress I'm gonna force this
'Cause it's holy don't try to fold me
Some just say peace tryin' to be black guy
Some say peace thinkin' it means bye bye
So G if ya never mean this from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs

Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart

Let's walk the path of a vocabulary
You'll cary the thoughts of every righteous man
Let's fight this plan of a other man
Waxin' thoughts of a brother man
Satan's waitin' for us to be hatin' each other
Sister brother or mother, color
Blackness don't try to attack this, fact this, let's now practice
True peace new salon one who is a peace
Cease when you see hunger than give a peace
Blacks a supplied them and applied them, identified them
You suffer inhale and say why them
'Cause you did not follow the path that I layed out
Say blackness and get played out
Like children wieldin' some try to kick a fist
Pick a fist and I take a piss, wickedness to get crushed up
Movin' up on that bustop while stand inhale bustop
So you must stop
Fakin' the holy faith in wakin'
Star don't come apart, our hearts get a stake in
So don't be mad so what minds to the minimum
'Cause in then a man sendin' 'em holy wisdom
To let you know if it ain't from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs

Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart",https://genius.com/Twista-no-peace-sign-lyrics
Feels So Good,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro)
This goes out to all riders worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Where playa hatin' killers and the hood niggas thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive
(Verse 1)
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch took a shower dried off
Brushed the gold teeth like slick rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh think
I'm blessed with the cest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch two women butterly lovely
In front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home 'cause one of them got chocolate big
Thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where ya'll goin' ya'll thick as hell, what's your name I wanna get up
With ya'll tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though we just ridin around bumpin'
Sounds trippin out while we flame janes
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang and slang cane to maintain
To mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit Speed
Pass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it and we can get into some ol nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus this ain't no spin
Move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by but hit the weed tip first
Cause my clique got to be riding high 'cause it feels so good
(Chorus)
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go
(Verse 2)
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up when niggas we lust
Smokin' some but the flame tight
Trippin' off how we survivin' the rugged terrian and try to hang tight
Getting fucked up on gang night
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the srap even we
Sent deebo back to back to back
We still be buildin' stacks and packs rollin through the blacks
Black ashtrays with blunt reds and crack sacs
We sittin' and chillin' what we're feenin' on been in bitches' cribs
Hopin its on the fenal strokin were strollin alone
Rollin the chrome out really trippin because we take the smoke to the
Dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones glisten from all
The sunlight
Peepin the fe's with thier hair done tight boody hung right
And every night we see at least one fight, hookin up with
My fellow Westside cliques
Now together we mush but when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin' every one of ya'll my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gone to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hope to get my thing on no matter what block or or street you kick it
Throughout the world its the same song (so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood now we got up on hittin'
The 'cause
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves mo' we got up on some
Bud, straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone smokin delight the body
Right what the party like are you as live as I
Come roll with me so we can ride the sky but only if you let me play
With you while we ridin' high 'cause it feels so good
Chorus
(Verse 3)
Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze thinkin how can I get mo'
Cheese
Bumpin' a system costin' 4 G's I stay on my P's for the po p's
Split the philly with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin' through
Sit on the floor playin' Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin' you turn out the lights like the World Class
Wreckin' Crew bring out the best in you
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs and where they been
Hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy what you feelin on maybe soft with
The silicone baby, but can you pay me
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll while rockin dope flows I'll
Lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about how later on you comin' out
Your clothes, shoes and socks now is that news or not
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O"" get a ""B"" and
Split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro on billets take a choke
On so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life but the hood life was still a
Good life and that we know
Always and forever though, for ever more rollin in the ghetto with no
Where to go and it feels so good

Mob Up,Mobstability,UnKnown,"Yeah, mobsta style for you muthafuckas, you know what I'm sayin'
We fin to bring this shit like this here
This muthafuckin' Chi shit, check it out

The niggas in my mob can't be touched
You best to mob up to come fuckin' with us, oh no
Niggas in my mob bring the heat
You best to mob up fuckin' with the elite, oh no

You just a bitch in the sky, I hear cries
Cause you can't whistle for your guys
Surprise when you saw this pistols in your eyes
So I peal like mere mortals, bet I shoot bloody portals
To muthafuckas who owe us, niggas die, causin' horrifyin' (?)
My passion for blastin' made me an assassin on all enemies that work us
Whose purpose is to serve (?) timbs 'til they high and they hurt us
Murders got us murders, I pull my weed and gun out
Blastin' 'til they run in the house while I got the blunt in my mouth

We in a rage bustin' rapidly like when I'm on stage
It don't get no rougher than Liffy Stokes, Twista and Mayz
In the blood of your day, then lay flat on your back
Then while he fuckin' your ho
The mob gon' be straight coppin' you stack

Your mob lacks, I'mma defeat you run three-two on contact
Cogniac, get me strapped with the black gat itchin' to bomb back
Hoes can't get no sleep
Bullets hit your chin for the grief that you bring us
Shots hit his face as he grabs his chest
Then we watch him bleed through his fingers
Now come on, come all, but if all come all fall, fuck all y'all
We road dawgs, then I come gunnin', niggas runnin' like they sold y'all
In the heat of the night, the (?) static we start up
Guards up, while we come strapped they come ready to mob up

If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You muthafuckas better mob up


It's a static, it's automatic, so grab the automatics
And pumps and pull the triggers and make some niggas look acrobatic
I was cold but frantic, the froze and panicked
They got bloods blew out their do me, bet the bullets run rapid
I kept bustin' for the love of hustlin' squeezin' my Russian
Ruger, gangland maneuvers, niggas wanna be bruisers but I'm a shooter
Fuck the squad, because when it's said and done
Liffy Stokes will do some poppin'


Nigga the devil's knockin' at your fuckin' door
With some hot ones in tow
And ready to hit 'em with nothin' less than four
Nigga let me go, I'm 'bouts to pop this bitch
You know you know the lick, art of the mobsta clique
Fuck the argument, mob elite's runnin' up apartments
Kickin' in doors pistol whippin' hoes be heartless
Searchin as the bullets marches between your arches
Make one call and wait and reload the cartridge
 - (2x)

You can't fuck with a mobsta, nigga, is you sick in the head?
I torture that ass and have you overdosing on lead
Or maybe I just leave you cut up, drippin' and dead
With your crew skippin' town scared, my lead gon' lead their ass red
Don't get misled, don't mistake me for somebody's foot soldier
The elite niggas got more death than AIDS and ebola
Getting old and colder
I be quick as fuck to up and buck that chip off your muthafuckin' shoulder

Behold the stack folder, gun holder, AKA blunt roller
Mayz if I die for you get your (..?..) and trap holder
To hurt particular niggas comin' with perpendicular figures
Crushin' triggers, y'all better bring back some ammo (?)

It really don't matter if that nigga pack a Glock or a gauge
Cause whatever the fuck Mayz blaze gon' make him see his last day
Takin' 'em out, my life and makin' sure his cast stays
Jack 'em for his last days, that's how livin' fast pay
Nigga, you know the word on the street
It's the mobsta elite that's servin' the streets to the rockinest beats
You better have a nice way to greet us than rolling with your guys
And you could still die in a multiple homicide

Animosity Kills,Resurrection,1994,"My mental complex can get as lethal as bomb threats
When I put together patterns and concepts
MCs evacuate when I activate raps of fate
Brain masturbates to ejaculate shit that decapitates
Niggas backs will break when I captivate
I'm strapped with hate when I'm at the plate
To fly motherfuckers' heads over the gate
Beat MCs at ease in a breeze, freeze 'em at 3 degrees
Flow deities, niggas don't got the key to these, ease
Over the shit that I'm busting, discussing us
And verbal dusting, I'm crushing guts and nuts
And leavin' niggas disgusted
When I'm thrusting like rockets I pull eyes out sockets
Put a clip to my lip and cock it for punks without a pocket
Top it, I'm too hyped to stop it, you're too microscopic
I dwell in the chamber like toxic
On point as if a sniper pops it, rhythms get optic
Are you ready for emergency surgery, verbally
For accusing me of flow burglary, third degree
Hotter than red devil niggas get burnt
Ruin the mothafuckas blessings until a lesson's learned
You earned the right to lose teeth if beef was instilled
Can it possibly build? I don't know but animosity kills

On stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
And Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)
Before the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
Speedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)

It's your funeral, so order some flowers from the florist
I'm turning the hardest chumps into bigger gumps than Forrest
You can't ignore this, vocals get omnivorous, catch rigor mortis
The trigger for this is the chorus, my guns are cordless, oris
My strategy's agony, make a scar that'll be tragedy
The majesty leaves niggas dead as car batteries, them raggedy
Rappers get ripped when the mic marauder chokes
Thinkin' tomorrow's hope, but death is in your horoscope
When my horror scopes, pages travel space ages, stages
I work 'em wise, when hype is on microphones I circumcise
Then hurt them thighs over bitches physical composition
Competition gets dismissed if listed as opposition
My mission's position is dissing
Take a hit of this, rather hit or miss
I still could split a wrist like a clitoris 'cause I injure this
I beat just to make agony bleed out
And me lose I doubt it, so if I'm in your path nigga reroute it
How'd it happen to my crew is what's said when I scare a staff
I tear in half motherfuckas with every paragraph
Sit there and laugh, 'cause you can't bear the wrath
As tragedy builds animosity and agony kills

On stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
And Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)
Before the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
Speedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)

I slay rappers of simplicity, it ain't shit to me
Get with me, I take the victory, you must not know my history
Sniff the scent of the magnificent, I done killed niggas in battles
Then when they come back with seconds I'm on some different shit
My prototype shows that I explode like Dolemite when I hold the mic
Niggas that test might as well throw the fight, my flow's that strike
Range from passionate to blasting it with yo ass in it
On the stage is where I let your casket sit, fast as shit
Coming through like a prowler, punks I devour
Testing me is worse than hiding from Norman Bates in the shower
Horror y'all, causing a fucking bloody waterfall
Only way I see competition is if you brought a ball
I slaughter all, pull your crew members just on a call
Plus admission but if you keep dissing we just gotta brawl
So what's the call?
If you let animosity build, tragedy will
And through defeat is when agony kills

On stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
And Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)
Before the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
Speedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging

Dangerous, venomous, sticking my teeth in

It's open season
Give me a reason to pull up on you with the shooters my team hold the roof
That means I do this I'm prudent I'm hold' my gwop in the safe like I'm  my crew is a nuisance

And as dead as this shit is Apocalypse Now
Head in the clouds and I'm  the crowd
If you actin' a fool I'mma single you out
'Til you blue in the face, you ain't true to the place
I'm a  so silence you ain't gotta trace
Outta the lines and I'm serving the place
Like a waiter, you wait, I out beef on the plate
And I eat it up, eat it up, eat it up, eat it up
Throw the K up in the sky and my feet is up
Over your head, better get used to it
Six in the ground now you live with a tulip
And slowly you dieing I'm seeing a newer 
Everyone I'm shining not an illusionist
But I got tricks, they doin' flips
Where go their lips? Right on my dick
Give her the kiss, I been through shits

Nothing but gangstas, thats all who I hang with
Slanging them thangs with, came up in the game with
The fucking hood rats, because them some broke hoes

The Manor in that K-Town, thats how we put it down
Letting off fifty rounds, thats how our shit sound
Artillery up the ass, scullies and ski masks
9's and bubble masks, gunning at your ass
Motherfucking street thugs, legit ballers
Money and the power, moving that flour
Taking no shorts and taking no losses
Hauling niggas asses off in coffins with that..

Where them stories are true about them Manor boys
How we leaving 'em, bleedin' and crawling on the ground

I ain't even gotta be there homie, I can get you touched cause

Motherfuckers told me they don't wanna hear me soften up
So I leave an inscription on the competition that be talkin tough
With a constant description about how much blood a nigga coughin up
Here open the coffin up, I gotta make sure the casket closed
I thought that the nigga would run, they said when I got him the bastard froze
You wan' see my name, as soon as you heard of it look at the murderous articles
So diabolical that I won't bother you, I get a nigga to follow you
And you can't get away cause the shorties got the Hemi on 'em
And when they pull up on 'em they gon' up the semi on 'em
And lock a steel, walk the streets, ain't gotta run from swali
I got '80s babies to touch you, I am Uncle Ollie
Twista Cartagena, Carl Corleone
If I say he gon' be gone then he gon' be gone
If I tell 'em that it's on then it's gon' be on
Have everybody say ""I don't know what the big homie on!""

Yeah, I got people, I got soldiers
I got niggas that'll knock ya head up off ya shoulder
For a blunt or two - homie look at you
Get your mind right and see me in a month or two
You ain't ready for a nigga like me
I get up close on you nigga live in 3D
With the silencer and slip it under my trenchcoat
Or I can hide in the back seat and slit a bitch throat
I get you poked, I ain't gotta pay big notes
My shorties do murders and they be like, ""What they hid fo'?""
They call me Lif' Stokes, I take hits and tokes
Go for it, I roll it up with four Lords and six Folks
Now I know you like, ""What you open up yo' lips fo'?""

Left the mob for something petty but then fetti got thin
Now you back where you begin while I'm livin on ten
Got inns sittin in a Benz wit rims sippin on Hen
Wit Stokes, Twist, and Mayze while you broke bitch I'm paid
Should of stayed but betrayed look at the cheddar you could have made
You started with the mob thought you was harder than the mob
But ain't no one motherfucker larger than this mob
Swear to god, for y'all C-Wall ain't got love
No only one that's gonna be on you side is this hot slug
For the dead and locked I'm throwin my mob up
Cock and bust to all y'all bitches die for crossin us

I smell some bitch niggas amongst us, now they gone
And when you see me on the streets be strapped cause I'm at you dome
And that's wit or without a mask on, cause I'mma blast on sight
Even if it's in traffic in broad daylight
The only way you live if it don't spray right
But you out your death wish so if I miss you'll be facin barrels by midknight
And that's on these four fingers I hold high
Anybody who crosses my mobsta family they die
I hollered at my boy James to bless me wit some mo' thangs
A mobstaz hard to kill like stopping off of cocaine
I'm leavin out sweated no dynasty clicks crushin bitches wit this
Nigga your songs ain't shit, they can't even fade our skits eat a dick

Nigga cross the mob so what's up
In every destination retaliation gotta fuck 'em up
Nigga cross the mob so what's up
In every destination retaliation gotta get 'em up
Shit are y'all about ready to die for this fetti fuck everyting that's petty
Down to do dirt lets put in work
Stay together whether we rappin of slangin ye together
Get the paper but don't cross the mob and get hurt loyalty's first

When everything was all good y'all niggas threw the wall up
But when the shit hit the fan I watch you bitches ball up
Now you time is all up, fuck who you call up
My niggas all bust, my killas all nuts
What the fuck you call us, what you say about C-Wall
Playa hatin how we ball, nigga we'll be to see y'all
And you mob gonna end up the same homie, put this pain on you
No love my slugs got them thugs name on 'em
If he wit his kids I'm blow his brains on 'em, put the chains on 'em
Go insane on em', guess he done wit that work range on em
Rain over, so nigga respect my mob like royalty
'Till I'm dead y'all hoes dred my love, life, and loyalty

When you come strapped in a circle
No I'm finna hurt you
Cause the mob put me peeped all of your loopholes
Cause the trigger work you
Bust all of you bitches and all of you hoes
When the bruh come
Thugs betta run shit look at what thugs want
See what drugs done
When held the gun got you runnin from a loved one
Thought you was down to die but you been found to lie
So fuck you can't trust you, gotta bust you
Crush you now you can't lick hits and hustle
Try to flex your muscle
But my criteria gotta over comes yo strategies
Try to make a mob out of peas
I can ride on you wit Money-T and an amount of cheese
Plus I had a lot of bud in 'em
I get mad at the budgin' 'em
Whippin out the stud in 'em
But I ain't even studying
If again and it's on I just put a slug in him
Duggin him dead and headin hoes off at the pass
Open up a can of kick ass
Toy wit me loyalty die quick blast

I roll wit straight mobsta leaners
That always carry beamers
And exercising trigger fingers on niggas who come between us
Shockin' the world wit young slingers
And we can't be defeated, even if you triple team us
Cause this game got my mod deranged if you in pain
Kamokaze like my nigga Lo if we loose to you man
So ready to aim cause it ain't shit to explain
Shots to exchange plenty of paper in the game
To help us remain on top of the world until we go bang
Doin our thang while y'all niggas just hate and complain in vain
But it'ws still gonna be the same we gonna mob forever
And out shine all you bitch ass niggas together

Before you get popped off, have some fun

9 times outta 10, you escape when you run
But if you can't get away then toss the gun

You'll be livin' in county hell

You wanna see this type of shit - NO
You wanna go this type of place - NO
All bullshit aside nigga jail ain't fun
Especially when you can't make yo bail and run
Sittin' in the D-A room talkin' about appeal
They ain't tryin' to hear that shit, be for real
When you hear that you'll be payin' a lot
Tryin' to cop out boy ??? hot
Ain't goin' home cause you ain't got bond
Betcha next time you'll remember to RUN

Cops see the same niggas in the same spot

Is he the same nigga that had the pack
They knew every place that you hid the dough
So you the muthafucka that wasn't on post
Playin' with them hoes all outta control
Served too slow when PIG's in the hole
If you knew you had a ????
Why the fuck you act like ice and froze
What was you thinkin' when you sold that crown
You coulda been bout three blocks down
Hittin' gates and gateways and all that
Kept all the cash, the yay, and the gat
Took you a break, woulda smoked you a blunt
Came back out and shot back up
C'mon, c'mon, and RUN
Hook 2x's

Leave the gateway open so I can dip through the back
Smokin' ??????? they got in a pack
Tippin' from all the hypes that's pullin' up on bikes
What the hell am I doin' out here servin' with two strikes
Niggas don't know I'm trainin' to be a track star
(Whoop, Whoop - Errrrr!) Put yo hands on the car
You must be one of them tight big niggas that's old
But I'm from the bigger number with the rhythm and roll
I hit blocks, dip cops
Kept the knot, dropped the Glock, ended up on Wilcox
It don't even matter now cause I done throwed them rocks
Went through a house that I don't know like I was Goldie Locks
I broke a sweat
Now I'm smokin' dro in a Lac
I'm throwin' a pack
Shit, I ain't never goin' back
If I happen to go to jail, niggas better tryin'
I make a getaway cleverly and never see time cause I'll RUN

Business didn't go right
And punks was dissin' my rappin' sound
That's when the grave digger buried me in the ground
Six feet down, verbally I would catch a beatdown
Niggas think I'm sweet, can't compete
And from a incomplete town
Cause they sleep on me
And can't see what's about to take place
Cause at a snake pace I can spit dope shit right in the fake's face
Gone a few years
Disbelievers often thought I would soften
Shit, I was gettin' so cold that I was coughin' in the coffin
And sharping up to cut those wit my shoulder blade
Makin' every word I speak a splitter
So motherfuckers reconsider
On testin' me
I'm straight out the grave with articulate shit
To kick rip through hypocrites when I spit you pigs hit the bricks
From the release of this album throughout the future
Niggas learn a lesson
Cause it's the mothafuckin' resurrection
Huh, now that I revert this acknowledge
That I set shit off right, not a soft sight
Make b-boys' bodies bleed till they turn off white
And if you broke mics, bring the battle
Or wait the day that won't take a break
When I make a fake
Rippin' mics like a paper plate
Escape the gate of the cemetery
When dug up out the dirt
I be hypin' I.C. Dre and I went berserk
Runnin' through apples like anorexics through exits
When it's man I flex it
Best be protected cause ain't no antisceptic
This sounds hectic
I strip rhythms naked when I mic check it
How does it feel gettin' fucked up by the least M.C. expected
Resurrected to wreck it for Chi-town to K-town
If you can't duck what's manifested I suggest you stay down
Infrared and Speedknot Mobstaz is what I campaign
Draw more blood than a artist
With a syringe when I vent brains
Stamp the names on the wall of those I'ma staff 'em

On the blocks with them O's when I'm droppin them flows, cockin the low
When the Twista hit the scene and that's like BLAKA explode
These lyrics to the tracks is like workin them pots on the stove
That's real

I got cocaine if you really wanna {""buy buy""}
I got ounces if you really wanna {""buy buy""}
I got 'dro if you really wanna {""buy buy""}
Rocks blows if you really wanna {""buy buy""}


Give me a look-up, I got the good hook up on cook up
If you low I'll front you to try to help you get a foot up
Police on my ass so I had to move a little bit quicker before I get shook up
Shit it's all the way I had to book up
Makin money for my good ki with a good cut
I spit that Cali kush, in the alley you can push
And the ki I stay low-key so Detective O'Malley won't look
Everybody be watchin my shows, everybody be rockin my flows
Got yayo and that's the way shit goes nigga, O's nigga

It's a seven day thing man
We do it all week e'ry week, we hustlin
Let me tell you how it goes again, aight?

Wanna See Em Buss,Category F5,2009,"The, the cars are so sick, mine'll make you vomit
Maroon forcefield, roofin' lining on the stomach
Six inches on the lips, the whole car be suave
Long story short I customized every body part
So these niggas be hatin', they stay so envious of me
Cause I keep bad bitches and they be with hideous honeys
And my city is ugly, they so gritty and scummy
Gotta be on point when I step out looking pretty as money
You want these rocks and these karats but you can't get none of that
You gon' get dropped and embarrassed cause I got a gun for that
I got a mob and I can't let you stop the mission
I got dreams of making billions like a crooked politician
If I have to I'mma murder, hit 'em with the rapid fire for the paper
Got a fully automatic dumpin on 'em
And I'm way up from the back, gotta go through with the caper
If I gotta feed my family I'mma sacrifice my body
And you already know that I be going Kamikaze

Cause you don't wanna see 'em buss
These young niggas out here don't give a fuck
We got the thumpers in the trunk, get your strap, if you gon' ride then run up
Or get sent to an early grave just for tryin' to act tough

Man I don't know shit about recession
All I know when it's dry on the block the shit's depressin'
Baby mama stressing cause I'm short on the support, talking take me to court
When she know when I got it it's good, but right now I'm short
You in everything I bought, from the cars to the clothes
So sit your ass down somewhere and let me work for this dough
I'm poppin mo's and my head's spinning
These haters hate cause they don't wanna see the trill winning
Swimming in fine women, laying in fine linen
And it's much deserved, I had it hard with this don living (you know)
Broadcastin live in all hoods and in all visions, analog or digital
62's in the serial; dreams of being imperial
Smokin on imperial O.G., I feel like Kobe
Mixed with a lil' co-D, all I'm missing is trophies
Rings and ceremonies, the bitches they love Stony
And the niggas that know me know I keep the 40 on me",https://genius.com/Twista-wanna-see-em-buss-lyrics
Kill Murder,Legit Ballin Vol. 2,2001,"(Turtle Banxx)
Most of you motherfuckers is comical
The rule like me is impossible
Verbally illogical I took the heat and then followed you to your residence
And spread your molecules blood floods your follicles
Damn right we don't acknowledge you
The streets got eyes of leopard for telling niggas to up weaponry
When they see your ass blast and feed your ass to the fish
Life's a bitch that'll suck ya dick
And tell them guys we hit that cash
Kick ass nigga they coming for the whole pie
Old time guys that won't be satisfied till you lay in a grave
Won't be satisfied till the location of the safe cave
Some were shining too much so I hide in the shade
The minute you made this move gave him one to his brain
(chorus)
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
In every video its
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
In every studio its
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
And tell me who ya know that
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
In every video its
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
In every studio its
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
And tell me who ya know that
Kill kill kill murder murder murder

Now I roll like minutes and foes with killers that fold
Idiotic motherfuckers smokin 'dro by the O's
More by the box so whats this is how we rock it
Beats by Cayex and Toxic
China White find a mic
Imagine you can't stop it
Enough of profit haters make me sick stay on the dick
Talking like they made me rich bitch please face it
Legit ballin gave me this and you can't take me
Cause you can't make it in this game you gotta hate it
Niggas kill me with that weak shit come around on street shit
Guns that don't reach shit in a talk of insanity
Deaths wanted at your ass blast your identity
Ain't no hoes over you ain't know
We don't fold we monopolize and ostracize hoes
Bitch ass niggas that try to rise
I'm sick of the die sick of the knives sick of the guy that say
(chorus)
(Twista)
I had smoked three fillos falling on these spindles
Its Twist and T Bizzle
When i blast heat metal he like like beat bittles we little
Niggas act like the heart and the heartless
That still bust contrages that rip through cartilage
Turn these mortals into gods and godesses
I bury ya slug in them haters claiming they veins pump up
Burying blood turns out y'all the scariest thug
On my nutsac thats how I get into sack
Sorrow hollows I spit at ya jag if he don't die he gonna shit in a bag
From K Town to V.I.P. ain't no V.I.P
Ain't no three I.D.'s
That'll get you to a place where we got keys and peas off our trees
Controversy wild niggas thats thirsty and bodily fluids
Smoking terror that'll smell bloody hands on your soul like mascara
Disciples of death
You won't even hear fears in they cry
Don't you hear that cold in they throat and see they tears in they eyes
My niggas rhyme thats all I love
Put a bullet to the sky but a nigga gotta die if he call my blood
So watch it when you say

Nigga, drank (this for the ones that be joogin, Twista)

One more joog
My niggas be trappin, straight out the land though
Red bandanna, lookin like Rambo
Used to be walkin, now I'm in Lambos
Still pullin joog after joog, light yo' black out like a candle
All I need is one mo', all I need is one mo'
E'rybody lay down, what you think that I come fo'?

I'm joogin, ridin 'round just lookin (one mo' joog, gimme one mo' joog!)

Twista, I'm a winner
Joogin in a city full of motherfuckin killers
Fuckin with them niggas on the corner servin pillars
And they get it every morning from the summer to the winter
With a pocket full of figures and I got the hood of niggas
And a banana clip for the gorillas
Throw up a middle finger for whoever don't feel us
Matter fact, if we have to we'd be comin after your dinner
I'ma drop a joog on you niggas right now
What you spendin 35 hundred for a pound?
I'ma take it 35 hundred joog 35 times
Make it 35 muh'fuckin pounds
C-c-city full of niggas that be misunderstood
And I might come and stick you up if you got the goods
Come in here talkin that shit, I wish a nigga would
You wanna know what they on when you in the hood


I could joog your tax
I'll make a quick hundred racks with that wire
Then flip it and bring it back
And make a few hundred stacks with that fire
Put the K roll in the Ac'
I roll one and sit back because I'm waitin on a hundred units
And if I don't come up off of that
I'm servin the dummy pack and face the drama when I run into it
Ain't nothin like us
Gotta send a shout to the lifers
Roll in the Camaro with the car crackers
In the club poppin bottles with the swipers
Shoutout to my plug

My hitters got hitters and they got bazookas on",https://genius.com/Twista-one-more-joog-lyrics

Bustin pistols while we runnin from the five-oh
Hit the adversaries up because we drive slow
I'm a killa mayne, standin on these corners
Hustlin for my dinna mayne, and if you try to move
Soon as I hear one shot
I'mma let the 
tec
 and desert eagle ride non-stop
If I have to I'll commit a murder just to maintain
Tell me what you thought I'm from a city where they gangbang
And I got that thang thang
Get it however you want it cop a fo' and then split
Hustle hard and work your way up 'til you holdin a brick
Cop an ounce of this 'dro I got the flyest shit in town
Bet you within a week you'll be able to get a pound
Go ahead and drop you can whip on 24's to get around

These niggas always gettin money in they inner circle
Fuck with 'em they fin' to hurt you; gotta get they cash on
Necessary evil they quick to put the mask on
Then they gotta put the mash on; steady bustin at each other
I take a tool and bust my strap and scream out ""Free my brother~!""
Bitch-ass motherfuckers; I'm about to break 'em out
If they hit me before they get me I'mma take 'em out
If we successful we gon' smoke a blunt and cruise home
Introduce him to his new Charger with no shoes on
'Til the haters move on
Fin' to set up shop now, gotsta hold the block down

Where the true thugs, and the elite members of the mob at
Know somebody; better call them now don't try to tell them later
Betta tell em 
""Where you from""
 when they catch you on the elevator
The fiends lurkin, niggas serve in pissy hallways
Can't say shit cause they be gettin money all day
Mercedes parked out front, chillin with a hat cocked to the left
In the ride with the Glock cocked smokin a blunt
300Z with the Lamborghini do's and some hoes with a big ol' project booty
And the beat kinda hot but the cops wanna come
To hold the work he got that duty
So they can't do nothin to me
Servin flo' for the 'dro now, nineteenth flo' by the rocks now
Gettin paper make me feel like... {la-da-da-dahhh-deeeee}

You ain't capo, you run your man's errands
Low on the totem pole, but me I hold the do'

The robber takin and born in the range
Battle the match and bang

Then I get in that as like cholesterol
I got the game lock dowm like Alcatraz
And if you escape you betta haul ass

Put 'em in the hot seat grab a ho
I'll show you some shit that'll make your eyes explode out ya skull
Cause bein odd ont the block is a N-O

On the streets or the stage
A 45 or a gauge
Thats why me and the Twista always hittin the front page
For what? cause we so damn cold
And when we enter the car niggas cluthcin they hoes
So fuck it, fall wit dust and get snatched
While Nitty bustes the facts in the Grand Finale

Yeah 'lil nigga its been once for you bitches
Y'all can't touch Legit Ballers
And just when you thought it was over

Fuck a car, I do a muthafuckin walk by

Leavin whole fuckin familys greivin
Cause if I miss some I gotta burn ya
Then I'm aressted (For what?) attempt murda
Never out done only out doin
Fuckin them bitches and then I leave 'em boo-hooin
Why?, cause they addicted, to what the dick did
The pleasure and pain the wing ding inflicted
Given niggas two to the head
Boy you can't mess wit a mad and hard head
Fool, I'm a straight low neva broke
Cause today I be a balla, shot shot caller
I dont give a fuck about one
Them hoes ain't even got love and they boo-hooin

While I'm still gang bangin bitch nigga catch a cap
Not easy but my nine easy to kill wit
Especially if you poppin bullshit

Ever compete wit Mobster Elites
Much Less beef

Never smile when the Twistas in the club

None of these niggas out here pay over 30 for those

I want you to go in there and get them niggas man

All about hustlin and bustin for change (wee straight)
To go there we can get in this bitch (wee straight)
Ballin for scratch ready to die for this shit

Don't you know that talking shit ain't wise
Nigga I'll advise you and your guys to get the fuck outta my presence
I got trigger eyes
Venom plower situations reaping bloody demonstrations when the heat dies
You won't see guys conversating
Only homicides and yellow tapings
No suspect no motives mad villains living bogus
If we don't catch you you best believe we tag whoever closest
And make you feel the motions
Turtle Banxx got kill notions thats real potent
Have you ever see I still smoking
Senile emotions you'll soul cokeland
Not a body open fuck ABC's
Best to be on P's and Q's I'ma get diseases if you snoozes
You ready yet?
You better study your tech and be a threat fucking coward
Or face trigger vests with celeb ways to wreck
Off with all heads and all bets
I'm on your neck sending straight .57 threats at your neck nigga

Straight .57 till your face don't blink
Nowhere to run no time to think

Nowhere to run no time think
So what you wanna do when it's on like that
In a chill when we steal and your soul get snatched out ya body
Catch me with a semi on cop
Been in your block dumping 17 shots in your spot
Putting niggas in shops ready for a box
Made my getaway slick as a fox
Taking the ditches the cops
Escaping visions of prisons and locks
My mission don't stop no pot to piss in so the plot thickens
I keep hearing gats clicking
See I'm into strange places
Wear a mask to cover up they faces if they want me why they procrastinate
Is it just in oasis?
Perpetrated by my imagination
Apple texas trojan am I tasting
My own death gun fire got me toned deaf
So I say a silent but I save my ownself
Can you clone death?
Like they do life I see the blue light hearing the sirens
Amongst the madness and the violence gun firing
Tragedies of lying in to I want a murderous round boy
That let niggas don't talk infa-red triggers caulk
A nigga trying to cheat life
Now death says name affiliation in the street life
I see nights away from the mics
Far from the henny and ice where many ya like for the riches and life
While shaking the device with a camera device like dice
From pistol fights nickel hypes murder and mics is life
In the Chi and Suge Knight
So think twice or faces vicious types in pit fights
(chorus)
The blocks hotted the cops watching for anything unusual happen
They been stoping profits three days in tracking
Drug traffic distracting clientele with drug habits
Load them thangs and make them slugs happen
Enemies of surprise got em frantic
Scattered and panicked damaged by any 11
Ducked behind a treasure box let em have it
Managed to get away hide away your weapons
Probably still there but they ain't telling
Belling to the bank for my safe deposit
Gotta take my grub on these narcotics properly watching
With a copy of my face composite
Description all the way down to the J's I'm rocking
Laser dots and the ducking police dogs hunting
Resistin everything I'm touching
Blood running down from the barbwire bloodening
Choppers hovering sirens coming closer
Grab our toaster, I'm supposed to surrender
But I done heard the shots from the trigger of a

Street Paranoia,Resurrection,1994,"As the paranoia takes over...
A man is quick to start snappin...
Cus as the paranoia takes over...
A man never knows what's about to happen...
As the paranoia takes over...
This is what's in the mind of a man that can be a shooter...
As the paranoia takes over...
This is what's in the mind of a man who lived times colder...

My feet walk the grounds of mental cruelty
As I'm surrounded by evil, in the ghetto the streets rule me
I look around and all I see is hatred
Bloods wasted, nothing is sacred
I don't know how long I can take it
Life is supposed to be priceless
But the ?cause of statics? suffers from automatics
Cus of a mental crisis
Ignorant thoughts and barbaric ways
And my hood's where it stays
There it slays, leaving no trace of better days
It's hard to grip the mic, when at night
All I see is hypes, going insane
In the brain, to obtain, the glass pipes
Life's a struggle, even for those who don't smuggle
In the alley drinks bums guzzle
Street life's a motherfuckin' puzzle
Leaving the best smoke, cus every rap chokes
Against the ropes of my people losing their dreams, lives, and hopes
My mental odyssey's hurt me with thoughts that could destroy ya
Damn, I can't face he paranoia...

You never know who's coming for ya, the streets can destroy ya... (Damn, I can't face the paranoia...)
You never know who's coming for ya, my mind is my destroyer...
(I can't face the street's paranoia...)
You never know who's coming for ya, the streets can destroy ya... (Damn, I can't face the paranoia...)
You never know who's coming for ya, my mind is my destroyer...
(I can't face the street's paranoia...)

As paranoia takes over, my heart stays colder
Ghetto slang holder, but still look over my shoulder
To see a shorty drink 40s and pop a pistol
For no reason, so the only issue is hope the bullet miss you
My mind goes in rages when outrages like some front' pages read murder committed by kids of younger ages
All these thugs know is drugs and chrome
Cus' Every night they never saw hugs and homes, just slugs and domes
Punks'll slang a game of starstacks, it's hard to face the raw facts
I witness bullets scar backs of carjacks
And through this all I make allot for days
Won't drop my ways at night they pop a gauge but still I chose to rock the stage
Is this a death trap as my every rep raps, the tales that left caps
In the bodies that finally get my mind collapsed
I'm hearing toxin', some pistols cockin', their poppin' bodies droppin'
Paranoia's got me, Constantly watchin'
Drugs and murder, imperial dealers and serial killers
Kids turn into casket fillers and hypes, the stillest
It's comin' for ya Is every man created a destroyer?
Damn, I can't face the paranoia...


The paranoia's killing me, terror's trilogy
In days to come do  you think we still a' be using artillery? Huh. Some kill for fun and enjoyment
Others for unemployment
Sometimes, I wanna say ""fuck it"" grip me a gun and point it
Herb eaters, thoughts of diseases as the flesh peels
But still the test builds;
I slowly start to see that stress kills
My willpower, I buss my best skills, but can't bear it
Sights of mack shooters, crack tooters
My thoughts are transparent
But yet deep, it's hard to get sleep, my eyes flinch
Beat the man in the dark trench
Dead on the park bench
Bullets sparks pitch, that shove an innocent child
Even though at the station Glocks pow, my mind is hostile
Now my style is being affected from it
To protect myself from catching one in the stomach
I'll be quick to gun 'em
The results: I might need a lawyer...
To keep myself from being locked in a cage facin' the paranoia",https://genius.com/Twista-street-paranoia-lyrics
Dont Hate Me -112,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Chorus: Don't be mad if yo girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault your girl is really feelin me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me
Q: It's a shame, but this game baby
I got it in me, ain't no lame when it comes to women
I'm all up in 'em
Sing a song, take 'em home, make 'em moan, then I'm gone
It's really just a game to me
Bridge: It's a role I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she callin me-callin me
If she's yo girl she wasn't yesterday-yesterday-yesterday
Chorus
Slim: How in the hell do you have the audacity
Runnin up on me tryin to talk to me
Checkin Me
When you need to be checkin yourself clown
Keepin yo girl from schoolin around
You call yourself a playa tell me how that sound
When yo girl is feenin for me and she wanna be down
Bridge:
Chorus:
Twista: Girl never seen a dude this down and dirty
Thuggin but he thought handling business but he not
Plenty women always wanna hold him just cause he rollin
Claimin they ain't got no job
But petty niggas they be comin at you bogus while you clubbin
Try to take you for the women they be fuckin
Talk about how he always huggin
Hope I don't have to hit him with the chrome oven
But just because a playa steady ballin people steady talkin
He say she say get you?
I saw yo girl talkin
But to 112 and Twista walkin to the truck bout to get
No snoozin
All the bitches be in big ballin confusion
Niggas trippin off ladies they be losin
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin for a bruisin
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil momma down, you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cuz yo kitty gone
Yo chick just chose me
You ain't cut like comedian tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playaz
Or three tone chamelon gators
You can't never spit fire on no cd and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me
I could never let a girl make me
There's plenty of women out here dog so don't hate me

Hope (a cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Cee-lo) Lyrics
(Twista talking)
Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers
And everybody lost period
All we got is HOPE!!
VERSE 1 (Twista)
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper had on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devistate, we shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!
Let's HOPE!
CHORUS (Cee-Lo)
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful!
VERSE 2 (Twista)
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain' strong
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's HOPE
CHORUS (Cee-Lo)
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful!
VERSE 3 (Twista)
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always so optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King 'Why can't we all just get along'
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let's HOPE
CHORUS (Cee-Lo) X 2
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful!

That's the first show of the three shows
I gotta flow - oh, one down, two to go

I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go
I rock the first show, ugh, one down, two to go

Steppin' up into a dancehall
I tell 'em, ""Dance y'all""
They do not reply
Because they think me not be fly
But I'ma make 'em jump, I make the people jump
But I'ma make 'em jump, I make the people jump
I pump the fly rhyme that be my rhyme
That I'ma rock in the funky party with
They think I won't, but watch how fly the party get
They follow me, follow me, black, I'm not wick-wack
They follow me, follow me, black, I'm not wick-wack
MCs be ever so angry 'cause I step in the fortress
Then I rock the party because I rock everybody
They follow me, follow me mic chants
I tell the men 'say ho', they say 'ho'
Follow me mic chants
I tell the men 'say ho', they say 'ho'
A victim of the way I kick them flows
I chose ten bros I picked from ten shows to rock the ten toes
I make the rhythm rough enough to make the feet scuff
Across the floors and rock them dirty drawers
I see your sweat pours, ya step with no flaws
I rock the second show with cuts like chainsaws
The mic is yours

I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go
I rock the second show, ugh, two down, one to go

Me comin' to flo-ow, oh-oh
It's time to rock a third show
Flo-ow, oh-oh, it's time to rock a third show
Me stamina rocks again
The tick-tocks of clocks again
Drops the men, they need some oxygen
If suckers think I'm wack I call 'em out like bingo
Or ooh-uno ;cause I do know hip-hop judo and you know
The hip-hop chops rocks akis, don't drop no ABCs
'Cause I only drop these to drop knees
Please, dis a Chicagod, ya lose
'Cause I can rock with stars and still get ahs and oohs
And voodoos choose to put me on tours, I rock like this
I rock a male and rock a female, ay y'all, pump the fist
Because I be rockin; the funky words and cheers are heard
That be the third show - three down, no mo' to go

I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go
I rock the third show, ugh, three down, no mo' to go, ugh",https://genius.com/Twista-one-down-2-2-go-lyrics

Run up to the car, got no things
They got CD's to break, no easy pace

Want to journey for herb
Always tellin' somebody to smoke somethin'

Didn't ask why I hit her for
'Cause the game like literature

Shake a lil' bit of that body

To my players an soldiers, shady n****s, young thugs and strap hoes
Pimps strikin' fees and red bones
Ghetto fees and Gs an MC's for the rifols

Snap Happy,Runnin Off at Da Mouth,1992,"Intro, I break a- break a brother ten fold
Oh, 10-4, stomp 'em like a dinosaur
Poor excuse for an MC, so-so singers
The things I bring'll snap like fingers
Rugged hip-hop, I'm gettin' funky like a cheap perfume
Doom, take 'em from the womb to the tomb, whom
It may concern, I return from the mentally dead
To fly a sleep sucker duck's head
A thoroughbred in this talent, I be snappin' like I'm coo-coo
Try to fade my spade, you made a boo boo
Suckers say 'ooops', troops - I spank 'em if they rap happy
Never calm, 'cause I'm snap happy

Am I snap happy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Yo, tell me - am I snap happpy?

Snap happy - snappin' on those who think I rap crappy
The Tung is snappy, rougher than nappy, you can't outrap me
Punk, with suckers I toy, I'm stronger than a droid
I don't avoid the noid, I destroyed the noid
So I gotta make a scrub pay, hey
Suckers I slay, they lay stinkin' in the subway
Focus, my rhythm will scrub, say rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause I'ma step into 'em like a bathtub
I make 'em run like waterfalls, use your eyes for pool balls
Then run through rappers like school halls
I'm breakin' sucka punks' backs
Facts on wax, when I step, instead of footprints, I leave tire tracks
My rhythm be delicious while
I flow, the skunk of this, funk of this
With a dramatically vicious style
I destroy your phoney hip-hopness like the Loch Ness
Monster, just because I want ta
1 to 2, I'm comin' through
Swig 'em like a brew, ooh
You think I bit off more than I can chew?
I break a sissy up with no twist
Don't make my tongue flappy
I still can be labelled as snap happy

Snap happy
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
DJ Jihad get loose

Hit me

I snap and make 'em yield
Spin my tongue like a windmill
And crack your skull like a windshield
Show me where a sucker makes an error, I give him terror
Be smooth as Aloe Vera, they run like mascara
I turn 'em over like a page, engage
I eat 'em with rage and trap the duck behind my rib cage
Flow, my jock'll make 'em blow
Want me to take 'em slow?
I flow speed till they can't take no mo'
Get the urge to see what I'm servin', bee
I make an emergency for the sucker to get surgery, word to G
You thinkin' what I said'll miss
But I'm the head of this, what I said'll diss
'Cause it's a mega-diss
If you sleep get into bed of this
But if you wake up, I'ma fly that dreaded head like Pegasus
I'm a son, but for some reason they wanna call me the rap pappy
I guess it's 'cause I'm snap happpy

Snap happy
Yo, tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?

Stick Up (Part 2),Legit Ballin Vol. 2,2001,"Whatcha gon' do when we come for you?
It's a stick up
Put yo hands up
Tell me whatcha gon' do when we come for you?
It's a stick up
Put yo hands up

We came for them, now they comin' for us
Whatcha gon' do when yo time is up?
We was unprepared for this lickin' plus
We been on the run from dawn to dust
Wrong nigga, wrong place, wrong car, wrong time
Guess I was greedy, shoulda kept the shine
But it ain't nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Fuck it, ain't givin' up nigga it's ride or die
They got us on the run now, in a high-speed chase
	Holdin' the Feds at gun point with no getaway place
Nigga look quit bitchin', I ain't even ask for yo help
	You keep talkin', I'ma burn both of y'all and get away myself
Man them streets got roadblocks, there's choppers in the ghetto
	Shinin' them lights on us, and them streets gettin' narrow
	Nigga the path I chose got exposed by yo ass
	Either get the ?? plenty ice and more cash
Nigga shut the fuck up, I got another plan
Here we go again
Bust 2 warnin' shots to remind 'em, we still got it man
	Tell 'em to lose the choppers, and if they don't we pop 'em
	See all them cars behind 'em, shit I'm itchin' to stop 'em
	My adrenaline's rushin', these bitches done ???
	Robert Taylor raised me, nigga the hood got me scarred
Damn Bennie, but this that real dilly
	And we done showed our asses like Mr. Billy
	Man here they come!!
Hook
Man I ain't in no joint, I got 2 strikes plenty
	I'm finna exit on 51st so we can get loose in a buildin'
Man we got a quarter tank of gas and a briefcase full of cash
	Back seat full of yay and the PIG's right off on our ass
Nigga look the yay counterfeit, remember this a hit
	They was supposed to escort dude but shit the bank we done hit
	Man it's the only chance we got to bust shots at them hoes
	Hand out the first meal so maybe the rest'll fold
Nigga you watch too many movies
Fuck that, it's our only chance
	Grab the wheel muthafucka so I can aim at the van
Man you stole a ride, sittin' on some shit that I ain't never seen
	By you bein' too greedy, this shit still all a dream
Man what the fuck, you givin' up nigga I don't need that
But in how the fuck we supposed to get away with just two straps?
	Now I could see if it wasn't no choppers nigga we might can escape
Fuck it nigga here go the Nextel, negotiate
	Tell 'em what we want
Shoot!!
	Hey c'mon guys, I know you guys can do better than this

No Pistols,Adrenaline Rush 2007,2007,"(feat. Speedknot Mobstaz)

Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga(put down that 45)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga(gotta let that 40 ride)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (let's do a homicide)
Don't ever wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga

Don't wanna see you with that 45 unless you gon' ride
If I say you gon' die motherf*cker I get so loud
What you be procrastinating I think you f*ck around with pistols cause they fascinating
You motherf*ckers ain't gon' do nothing
When you get through frontin niggas out here already know that you ain't gon' shoot nothing
End up at the pearly gates when they test you
Gotta dirty face but what you know about a 30 ain't special shit
And I know them hard words make you jump up with your? when you got the mosburg pump bitch
And the shortys lookin at you like a punk bitch
Cause you ain't making what you claim ain't gon' dump click
You gon cry when you hear them bullets dumping when them shortys come and ride on you(when the pistol click clack)
If you still alive will you really get the dumpin if you got that 45 on you?

Once upon a time in the sha there was three real killas who bust guns and puff fire
They cut weight by the key and baggin every gram
Instead? bustin with the pistol in they hand
I'm preachin murder like a vicious reverand
About niggas who claim they shootin but they never seen 357s
Now what reason would you hold it up
Put that pistol down nigga pick that weed up roll it up
Twista up the light you don't really won die
Stop your blood clot crying
Your bullets don't fly
? aim smooth? I keep that smith and wessel with me like I'm blackmoon
Toss up the living room storm through the kitchen
I caught that nigga in the bathroom shittin and pissin'
What you shakin' for I thought you said you ready to ride
Don't be coming with me if you ain't strapped because I

I keep a p95 nine milli ruger
You f**kin with a shooter
Quick to bloody your suit up
My aim impeccable point like a decibel
300 feet away in a tower snipin a festival
What you know about 9's and Glock 40's
And 45's see our 15's with the 5 pound slide
Thirty shot clips snub noses with the rubber grips
Wicked techs that'll put the kiss of death on your lover's lips
 we get the squeeze nigga
Ak-47s make them bitches retreat nigga
Like a g nigga
I make em bleed nigga
? I'm bustin that's on my c nigga
My war chest is filled with ballers and techs
Ski masks gloves and vests so nigga what's next nigga
It's real thuggin you a bitch to the bone
If you ain't go through nothin shorty leave them pistols alone",https://genius.com/Twista-no-pistols-lyrics
Dont Hate Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me

She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me
It's a shame, but this game baby
I got it in me, ain't no lame when it comes to women
I'm all up in 'em
Sing a song, take 'em home, make 'em moan, then I'm gone
It's really just a game to me
It's a rule I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me, callin' me
If she's yo' girl she wasn't yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Don't be mad
Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me
How in the hell do you have the audacity
Runnin' up on me tryin' to talk to me
Checkin' me
When you need to be checkin' yourself clown
Keepin' yo' girl from schoolin' around
You call yourself a playa tell me how that sound
When yo' girl is feignin' for me and she want to be down
It's a rule I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me, callin' me
If she's yo' girl she wasn't yesterday, yesterday, yesterday

It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me
Girl never seen a dude this down and dirty
Thuggin' but he thought handle business but he not
Plenty women always want to hold him just cause he rollin'
Claimin' they ain't got no job
But petty niggas they be comin' at you bogus while you clubbin'
Try to take you for the women that be fuckin'
Talk about how he always huggin'
Hope I don't have to hit him with the chrome oven
But just because a playa steady ballin' people steady talkin'
He say she say get you?
I saw yo' girl talkin'
But to 112 and Twista walkin' to the truck bout to get?
No snoozin'
All the bitches be in big ballin' confusion
Niggas trippin' off the ladies they be losin'
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo' hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil' momma down, you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cause yo' kitty gone
Yo' chick just chose me
You ain't cut like? Tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playas
Or three tone? Gators
You can't never spit fire on no CD and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me
I could never let a girl make me
There's plenty women out here dog so don't hate me
Don't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man

Yeah, I'm talkin' to you nigga
You ain't no killa, on the riz-illa
So High Beam my nigga, get with 'em

AHHHHH!!

When I look that fool in his face and tell him he's a lie
Everybody want a cure but nobody wanna die
Put the cash in my face, I might take a try
Money motivated that nigga that threw up my sign
My wife's on my side with a .9 ready to ride
Hold my sixth sense up and ask buddy why
Shit get deep in the cold city of Chi
Could somebody, anybody tell me why-ay
Why-ya-y-yaah
Why-ya-y-yaah these boys they wanna try me-eeeee
Why-ya-y-yaah
Why-ya-y-yaah but these boys don't wanna die-eeeee

Straight down to earth with my real niggas crack 'em beers
Straight up that mean mug muthafucka havin' no fear
What the fuck
You thought I was one of them bitch niggas standin' right here
Legit Ballaz is the clique I break bread with
Niggas I bust lead with
In the midst of confrontation, high-speed chasin'
Bend 'em, and bust 'em and stick 'em, I'm runnin' from the FED's shit

Bitches in the neighborhood spreadin' disease
Hatin' ass niggas starin' and studyin' me
Cause I'm fresh up out the bank to get my daughter some cheese
But I got somethin' on my side like a lemon to squeeze
Lickin' bout a pack up at you muthafuckaz right at the knees
Probably givin' somethin' to fools cause the man in need
I been deep up in this game for a century
Now I'm makin' major moves and stackin' paper is my motto
Different day, different gear, hoppin' out a different auto
Put it on and I'll be jackin' off louchers like lotto
Showin' love to my niggas who show me love in Chicago
It's fair but it's square, for the love of the game or they hate it
Many done died, plenty done tried from imitatin' it
Fuck what they say, keep faith in this world you'll make it
Thank him for everythang and every blessin' but don't fake it

Trapped up in this wild life, thinkin' to myself
Askin' the Lord for forgiveness and thankin' him for my wealth

Fuckin' up muthafuckaz lyrically with the Beam
Got you and yo boys losin' yo breath like ??
Never disrespect a Legit Balla when on the scene

Shit... it's time to show niggas what's really hood

Bussin never discussin
People are runnin niggas is gunnin
Killers are runnin because it was stunnin
Hearin the ambulance when it be comin in

Roll in the Chevy Malibu I know they dig that
In the secret compartment is where I hid that
Try to avoid wherever I see the pigs at
Forty-fo' and black Calico when I push your shit back
When I'm out of town I go wherever the hood at
Because I know where I can get somethin that's good at
The dopefiends is gon' show me where the kush at
Ain't got no cigarette loaded where the backwood at
Come walkin up and get a pistol in your face hoe
If you want an autograph you better say so
Otherwise everybody gon' have to stay low
Cause I'm about to give this motherfucker a halo~!


Bodies droppin pistols poppin we bustin our tecs
People scatterin around like it was a bomb threat
Got plenty ammunition, show me where your ones at
So much terrorism they askin me where Saddam at
Like Bush I alarm 'em bomb 'em let fire open out
Go forth catch him open choke him and try to smoke him out
Shit is serious I'ma show you what this dough about
That's what you motherfuckers get for havin an open mouth


I'm killin new arrivals every time I shoot a rifle
Leave you suicidal cause everything I do is vital
Displayin mo' evil than the preacher that threw the bible
Win a Bentley don't think it's mine 'til I show you the title
In the car breakin up trees, call me a lumberjack
You say you a baller then nigga where the hundreds at?
Get me in the club, it won't be none of that
A 22 on my body like I'm a Dallas Cowboys running back


Catch one in yo' leg if you RUN UP
Catch one in yo' body if you RUN UP
Catch one in yo' head if you RUN UP
You can end up dead if you RUN UP
I'ma cop me a Benz when I COME UP
I'ma cop me a Beemer when I COME UP
I'ma shit on the phonies when I COME UP
I'ma hit all the homies when I..


I lay you niggas out like tomorrow's outfit
You gettin me pissed, you niggas ain't about shit
Before you get me started I suggest you bounce bitch
I got AR-15's to come up in yo' house with
To tell yo' woman she look good in them killer jeans
Think it's butter I wanna cut her like a guillotine
Need to get at her but right now it's still a dream
I'd like the thong, but right now for the microphone I'm still a fiend


I'm on the block servin up rock like Johnny Unitas
With killer niggas we didn't really care if you like us
Vicious, so cold, that I be catchin laryngitis
Still shit that's hotter than any temperature on fahrenheit is
Gotta read celsius just to say you felt me bust
Better be yo' healthiest thinkin you can belt me up
All up in my face talkin 'bout you gon' tell me WHAT
I ain't gon' be the one needin my homies to help me up




Now come in with that let me take a lil' hit of the blig
This pussy nigga right here wanna get rid of my nigz
He don't want it cause we got the chrome thing-a-ma-jigs
And I make a nigga quit rappin and go get him a gig
I'm buck when I'm on a mission you better watch how I do
You got what I want so I'm creepin cause I got a rival
I'm thirsty as FUCK~! and money is the water bottle
Thinkin you hard to follow but I'm on you like Polamalu


With the shotty I'ma bring drama to you quarter leagues
Make that mighty dollar if I gotta transport a ki
Call me Ali Baba cause I'm runnin with 40 thieves
30-somethin and I be hotter than all the shorties be
32 shot automatic, yeah I call it magic
Two clips, 34 shots, pall bearers and a casket
A couple of Glocks, to kill off any cause of static

I feel like I'm goin' crazy so I'ma shell my brain
My niggas out here droppin' off over rocks and thangs
Mama never told me life was such a dirty game

I hold my Glock to my chest, yes my steel is cold
I pray to God to come to rescue me and save my soul
I reminisce on my past life
Ever since I was a young shorty I didn't act right
Live for the street life
Yellin', ""What it be like?""
Nigga we Folks
Money makin' hustlaz from the Westside and it shows
In these past years, shit it's been a hell of 25
Back in '91, I didn't even think I'd be alive
I was sellin' jewelry to rocks, and rocks to weed
Off at the comfort zone G with a fifth of T's and B's
Ready to do whatever, young with a pocket full of cheddar
No thoughts of stackin' just ballin', picture me fallin' nigga never
In this lifetime
But I had to grieve for awhile
Cause a nigga fell off hard but I got my ass back on the grind
And hit the streets like a mad man, goin' against the grain
With dried tears on my face from the pain of this dirty game

Fresh out the pen and can't maintain
Wanna go and hit the block, be on the same thang

You fuck around and catch a bullet in yo forehead

This ain't the 80's where you get a nickel sack and a hoodrat
A 40-ounce of Red Bull and blow yo wig back
Nigga fuck that, this the year 2-G
Where the toughest muthafucka get left 6-feet deep
So don't sleep, cause the scariest nigga'll pull the trigga
Put 2 in 300 pounds, so that makes you a killa
Oh really, could you be that silly
To think you gon' take over a block where I been committed - nigga forget it
Don't make me have to blow yo brains
In this fucked up world, this fucked up life, this fucked up game

Hey nug, for some reason at night I can't sleep
When I lay down, I keep tossin' and turnin'
There's somethin' wrong but I don't know what's wrong with me
Eyes burnin'
Cause sometimes I burst into tears when ain't nobody home with me
Stress from thoughts of survival just rushed my dome quickly
Y'all better come on get me
Cause I bout to do somethin' so muthafuckin' drastic
Instead of writin' essays like grabbin' SK's
With one of the best ways that I know to feed my family
Cause y'all ain't foolin' me
Y'all people plannin' a way for my people to read my eulogy
I see what y'all bogus ass doin', y'all plannin' on hurtin' me
Used to be crucifyin' or burnin' me
Now you eliminatin' paper currency
Terrorizin' with technology
And that Y2K shit, I don't know why you play with the chosen guys
The wool ain't no longer pulled over my eyes
Gots to get some scratch and I gotta get it soon
We about to be doomed
Do somethin' for the kids before I go to my tomb
Gotta bust this thang and maybe then thangs gon' change
Tryin' to check mine, cause all of it on y'all I can't blame
Maintain, it's a strange game
At times you gotta throw blows for the gold
It's a long road, some of us do shit despite losin' our soul
Got cold flows but it's strange, I still can't get no change
Bout to be insane
Tryin' to pay the bills but still straight causin' pain

Middle Of The Night,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ahh yeah mic check 1, 2
Eightball and MJG space-age forever

It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night

I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night


I'm on late night mission top let down
That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I want to take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight",https://genius.com/Twista-middle-of-the-night-lyrics
Stories,Legit Ballin Vol. 2,2001,"Yo Fiend, what up man? (Yo, yo)
You rollin' with these Legit Ballaz right? (Whomp)
Aight, well check it out
Won't you tell these muthafuckaz a lil' bit about where you come from

Fire arms, sounds of alarms
Consistency in bodily harm
Where I'm from that's the norm
Fiend the ?
Lil' nigga ain't no man of creaton
Once we encounter the killin' spree we on
My defects have G's bet on
Niggas dollars get they rep on
Speakin' with heat ? could bring death on
Nigga I'm called the killa
Cause every time he get it, it brought chills
Lead that's what made 'em take his ass for real
I done ? survivor
He never wrote the name of his drivers
And wondered that the man can deprive ya
It's there in black ink
With millions in dirty green had to think
Lives depreciated over drinks
Call me twisted
Rope burns to the neck was insisted
And all his hope turned to ""I guess should I risk it?""

And that's why the law is laid down
You know what I'm sayin'?
From Fiend to N.O. to Chi, Twista
Pimp run it now

Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain
I said some survive the game
Some just get they names in the stories to be told
Why the young never make it old
Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain
I said some survive the game
Some just get they names in the stories to be told
Why the young never make it old (Why the young never make it old)

I live my life drownin' in homicide
Never let the drama slide
We killaz quick to let it ride
Send a nigga beddy-by when I let it fly
Niggas be yappin' but they scared to die
Talkin' plenty shit till I cap off with the .45
Look into these smoke red eyes, feel me starvin'
Feel me shakin' up that dope in my apartment
And picture me on top of the world and still servin'
Blessin' all my shorties with birds to keep 'em workin'
As long as my hood is tight, my mind is right
Look at the dope line tonight, just doin' aight
For the nugs
Y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug
This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good
With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's
With the itchy sittin' dead on the seat
For the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down
For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rid-ounds
Hook

Never thought that the cries of my people would get louder
When Chief first came home with that glistenin' white powder
But it gave us power
Never thought them ? packs that had us buyin' clothes and pullin' hoes
Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes
(That's how it goes)
And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit
That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit
By-standers got hit up
And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights
Lightin' pilot lights
I would be crept on my a mask on silent nights
Now I'm wonderin' and thinkin', how can a man make a sack off his merch
Flip a new Lac with his work
End up in the back of hearse
Then be packed in the dirt
Flaked over turf, can you hear the Mack when it 'sperse
He get cracked where it hurts
Feel the automatic when it jerks
Comin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk
Is that what it's worth naw, niggas got the chrome and TV's in the whip
Knowing that the law got his name on the list
Bet they got a mob and they mob full of tricks
You ain't on yo P's, you gotta be
Fuck a sure strategy
, don't be punked like no lame
You just a 
pawn
 in the game
Steady baggin' work, hittin' licks, and stackin' cain'

Bath and Bodyworks,Reloaded (Don Cannon),2012,"Never talk about or be about it, I give you the vision of a movie through the eyes of a crook
Put in jail for nothing doing to me and my people better put some money on my books
Spit it for smokers cause I know about dro
Spit it for pimps cause I know about hoes
Spit it for niggas that get money and do murders in the streets
Ok, I know about those
If you know somebody that gotta get down come and holla if you know they really wanna get a pack
If it go through, they gon' do a lil something for you for bringing their bidness back
Go head and holla cause they cheap, I know them niggas
But it ain't got shit to do with me, I just mow them niggas
Living good life look, jack city bitch, driving cars the be the shit, rack city bitch
Spit it like a mini mac clip or a Thompson machine gun, run 'fore I make 'em backflip
Will he live to see another day if you don't get immediate medical attention from all the bullets in em
Let me slow down before somebody gotta die try'na pull it with 'em
Chi-Town don't like nobody, Twista fuck that nigga
But if somebody touch him its on, he's Chi-Town, we love that nigga

Re-act With a Mic,Resurrection,1994," Chi-town and my town
 No doubt
 A-yo, yo
Yo ring the bell or watch me swell a bigga nigga, baby pa
Upon the passages the man with massive repertoire
The New York undercover Tri-borough representative
Be ever thorough in takin' niggas out like the editor
I put it down pickin' it up to get ya open
I'm the lesson niggas testin' be like destined
To be broken down, like matter
A fact I pimp it fatter than them
Or any other nigga talkin' that I be wack
Come now, son how the fuck you thought I would avoid
Fuck that star shit, niggas get their ass-teroid
My motion opens eyes like the coast and I co-host
Your roast, smokin' fuckin' phills with your coast, bitch
I put clowns in big shoes on the stage
You niggas don't know, had better vibe like a page
Don't switch and watch me catch you like no other can
Dres bitch I'm in the fuckin' house like Bruh Man, and yo
Fuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Dres and Twista watchin' sucker motherfuckers take flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Like a missile, we geek and seek style that takes flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Catch the gist of the niggas down to set it tonight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
I embrace the mic like a axe when I hear tracks
React on victims with vengeance, hostile is my attack
A spittin' image of death when it comes to microphone battles
Illustrate fate with hate, creepin' on M.C.'s like shadows
Murder provokin' mics I'm smokin' like fat weed all day
No concept 'cause I be fresh from out that town called K
M.C. death increases, cut 'er up so you can pick up the pieces
Kill off more sissies than Spacek without telekinesis
Lethal as sayin' Mxyzptlk backwards when I wreck track
I come exact to pressure punks, pain for brains I extract
Intrude M.C.'s fears, think I'm the night creep like the black sheep
Attacks will equalize coats cold rappers stoled from back seat
The mack is sweet when pimpin' stages
Punks that think they can can next to me
Step and see, I bring out ecstasy through complexity
Textin' me can't out-shoot this here
Misfits get bloody like Prom Night
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Fuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Dres and Twista rippin' shit so motherfuckers take flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Like a missile we got you seekin' style that takes flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Catch a gist of the niggas down to set it tonight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Yo what can you do, I stand out like a clue
With a twist I dissed the motherfuckers knowin' the taste of my piss
Face to my fist disconnect necks with my checks and tape decks
Drop rappers off my skill's apex and caught tryin' to make threats
Nigga-ro please, nigga freeze, nigga get on your knees
And get killed son, I serve a billion like the Mick-a-dees
Be no fifty degrees I freeze M.C.'s bust three to the chest
Put teeth to the test, I kill on ship like B to the X
Yo, swingin' like nunchucks, I'm rippin' up stupid fucks in a tux
I back, flip spin and kick a style that's deluxe
So what's up, I react on niggas like Jason on blow
Blood's wasting on clothes from shanking with flows and splittin' through foes
See, niggas got a suicidal tendency
Talkin' all that battle shit and we like splendid, B
But, keep that flavor, 'cause I got than that I gave ya
Me and my neighbor at your funeral with party favors
Huh, the Twista splits heads like a divorce wit' no remorse
Wild as claustrophobics in closets when I bring the Porsche
With galactic tactics I max it, unless a convict when I honk it
M.C.'s from separate cities on some bomb shit, word
Fuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Dres and Twista watchin' sucker motherfuckers take flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Like a missile we got you seekin' style that takes flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Catch the gist of the niggas down to set it tonight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Yeah, no doubt representin' out of New York I represent like a delegate
Speedknot Mobstaz, Campaign Click you know what I'm sayin'
Straight from the Chi
Queens what's goin' on, Brooklyn, Bronx, Staten Island
And peace out to K-town, peace out to Fish City

That tend to diss the Twista, to hell with dem dumb {fuckers}
Respect the way I kicks 'em, I'm rippin' vics up
Bloody spits up, and never gets up
When I speed, nah clicks up
Rips up with grammar when I damage ya like Jeru
I'm torchering sucker punks, on backtracks I see Dres do
Hit 'em with lyrical dropkicks, poke eyes with chopsticks
Flyin' more MCs heads than cockpits
With criminal topics, as soon as the Glock spits I drop vics
Quick to commit a murder

Homie fuck what's the issue, they will go nuts when I diss you
Crazy for once in my nickels so bring a customer wit'chu
Hit him with the back of the pistol and knock him unconscious

Psycho as they get, I'm the shit, don't get hit with the burners
I'm heartless, I'm dark as  is the difference for murder
Plenty riches I earn as the best and the bosses know it
So much paper in the room I'm becomin claustrophobic
Get my message out to the thugs as if I talked to Moses

It's a gangsta party, weed chasers, a block, three haters
Bitch fast cars, a hand of gorillas, speed racer
No NASCAR for that green paper
I blast the Glocks to your team later
Don't ask why I holla back, scrap Holocaust, nigga I'm a boss
Cause that dead man pick-up flow, try me come across

I live life Sinatra in Vegas, Armani garments

Run to your little hotel room discharge five

Gettin caught up in that bullshit is irrelevant
I'm too grown for my stakes, and these bitches I break
Cause I'm a fuckin snake, fuck you nigga go and hate
Shit I'm a time bomb, that's why I stay armed
And I smoke that backwood to keep my nerves calm

How I Feel,UnKnown,2015,"All they know about me is how many times they seen me high
They don't really know what I be goin' through
They don't really know about how many times I cry
They don't know about the struggles and the pain
They don't really know how many nights I been up
But when I'm ready, I'mma open up
When I'm ready, I'mma open up
Somebody ask me, 'Twista, where you been?'
I tell 'em, 'I don't know, cause the curtain was closed in the Benz'
Too cold with the pen
Comin' off the top I can flow from within
Years in the game, I could study, get in
Cause they can't figure out where do I fit in
They don't want to know if I'm legendary or not
They don't want to know if they want to give me the throne
They don't really know if they gon' play my song
It don't matter, I'm cold, so forever I'm on
They don't want to say if I'm the fastest
Even though I held the record for years and I do it with finesse
They don't want to get me in a war
Cause I'd rather him 'em with a fast flow than display my stress
Well, here it go
Am I the magnificent with a weird flow?
That you don't want to give me the respect I deserve
Cause I be comin' superb, I'm not your hero
But I'm one of the coldest, bitch
I said it before and by now everybody should know this shit
Don't want to have to load this clip
I'm nearer to Starbucks, it's just to get you to hold my dick
Cause I will
Don't be the victim of a copster's steel
And a motherfucker got killed
Cause I'm a gifted cause I got good
If I can't give it cause I got skill, and I will spit it on a track
Would make it so a go-getter could stack wheels
Sorry if I offended you
I just got to be real and tell you how I feel

Business never did shit for me, remember that
Grindin' all by myself, remember that
Started from the bottom, now I'm here
But they tryin' to hold me back
Remember that? Yeah, I remember that

I'm surrounded by these demons and they drive me crazy
They love to see you fail, I guess that's why they hate me
Lately, I been stayin' away
See, you wouldn't believe the bullshit, but now it don't amaze me
I grew up gettin' beat on, my world ain't got no heat on
They ask me what I be on, but then find out that they need some
That's why I did this new song, that's why I keep that two long
Been in too deep for too long
Those who doubted me and want my way gon' prove wrong

Yeah, to anybody who doubted me
And my whole damn team wrong
Wake up in the mornin', this a theme song
I'm gonna make a lot of money of this green (-)
But I refuse to ever sell my damn soul
Middle of the summer, but my flow's cold
I want to meet up, but your bitch is for my old hoes
All I need is a beat, I'm goin' loco
Yeah, a lot of people tellin' me that I'm next to blow
They can keep the fame, I just want the dough
If I hear my family eat, then we good to go
I got to stack this bread, then I'm out the door",https://genius.com/Twista-how-i-feel-lyrics
No Heart,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now when it comes to blowin' dro you know I got's the bomb
Quick to dump these bullets up in your ass like Lebron
Got me bustin' at these haters, I'm a motherfucking killa
Just call me the West Side Mobster, I'm your real ass nigga
Motherfuckas try to play me cause they know I get my cash on
Do a 187 with this motherfuckin' mask on
Jumpin' up outta the truck
Deep as the bass on this bomb beat
Tore his dome apart, left his brains on the concrete
Now I gets more paper then the rest of these ballas
Runnin' to the tat by the tat 
With the street sweeper from the corner
Never catch me slippin', cause I'm known to keep a trey pound
Lay down, blast on that ass cause I'm from K-town, nigga
They hated since the very start, so I shitted on the game

That's why Twista gots... no heart
(Ain't no love bitch)
Twista gots... no heart
(Ain't no love bitch)
That's why Twista got's no heart
 x2
Finna shoot a nigga up (x2) if he do not wanna get me my payuh (Ain't no love bitch)
Kill a nigga for the dust (x2) cause that's the chi town way-uh (Ain't no love bitch)

It's me and T-T-Twista rollin' 6-4 Impala on gold
Its top back, Glock on my lap, LAPD-patrollin'
Ghetto bird over my shoulders, I'm a boss
And I catch bullets in the field like Randy Moss (moss)
I'm the face of L.A, got L.A on my face
Hydraulics in the trunk, and the cake by the safe
I don't bathe in apes, I got gorillas in jail
I wear hoodies for real, you wear hoodies like Pharrell
Pharrell got pastell colors on him
I got a TV in the Range showing colors on it
Sellin' candy rain, it's for lovers only
Push coke till I die, put my dead brother on it
As I ride with my gun in my vest
Niggas in the Chi call me Kanye West
Cause when I'm fresh outta Hennessy I'm buying the bar
Toast for my nigga Shyne in the pen
(This is the tracks ...No Heart)
 x2
Finna shoot a nigga up (x2)
If he do not wanna get me my payuh (Ain't no love bitch)
Kill a nigga for the dust (x2)
Cause that's the chi town way-uh (Ain't no love bitch)",https://genius.com/Twista-no-heart-lyrics
Legit Ballaz,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Feel the heat from our gunfire, when you see us coming
Their your niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
Y'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome
Smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' money
Getting down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody
Havn't you heard off these muderous cats, ballin' for scratch
Niggas shootin' nervous with gats, so hot we circle this drought
I drops them hollows, shots to swallow, my motto be ""fuck tommorow""
Sorrows improbable
In Chicago motherfucker, bones get fractured, crumble like crackers
Rush the stage, allow the crowd to witness your massacre
You ain't bone, you're marrow, the lead travels from barrels
Bloody apperal, unravvle, chances is narrow
Thugs get judged when I drop slugs like gavels
Embarrassed and baffled
Got people and cattle getting slaughtered in battles
In gang land, we bang and ride, vibed gettin' high
Ain't no explaining, represcussions if you don't comply
Get ready motherfucker, my city's full of brothers who struggle
Breed's, T's, I's, U's, C's, Four Corner Hustlers
Black souls, magic kings and if gats could sing
My lyrics squeeze desert ease will rock you to sleep
Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
Y'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome
Smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' water
When y'all come up shorter
Try to come at the mob and get your body slaughtered
I got love for all niggas yelling out ""fuck the police""
I'm a Jeffery Manor Gangsta wit' the mobsta elites
Legit Ballers the family 'til the day that I die
They let the south and the westside hook up in the city of Chi'
Lettin' off rounds, fifty rounds, 'bout to shut you bitches down
From the Manor in that K-Town, I say it's too late now
For you niggas that hate now, better stay out my way now
Before you end up facedown
You motherfuckers don't know a thang about me
I roll wit' G's from Cabrini down to the Ida B's
Lakeside, 9-Tre, the Long City
Wild Hundreds got love for that nigga Nitty
Give me room when my adrenaline rushing
Cause if I go in that trunk, you know I'm 'bout to start dumping
You hear the cries as the bullets fly by
And in the end that motherfucker died
Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
Y'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome
Smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' money
Gettin' down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody
Hungry, I was lookin' for the fetti', ready
With the mental that was heavy, now her niggas ain't ready
Fuck the Navigator, we was filling holes in that 87' Chevy
Sitting on thirty-thirties
Selling leaf and syrup on the corner trying to stir this
Had a strap with the handle that was pearly
Up early, (?)
Know the game don't scare me, competition better flury or get buried
Either scuffle or scurry, brother hunt the word down
If you want a piece better hurry
Got off our knees and putting arrows on our tip
But there's really no need for you to say we ain't shit
Got up the cheese by telling motherfuckers freeze, and run in their cribs
Now we like to ball legit
Got to get up off the gold and the dick
Roll with a clique of hustlers thats strugglin'
Pistol bustin' and mean muggin'
Get up out the way my armored heavy family huntin'
Cause ain't nothin' gonna stop us from rollin'
Rap flow and the strap holdin', tired of feeling like I'm closed in
In the back, roll in on my ass when we got going
Out the back door like smoking
And tripping on the brink of success or failure
Momma, I can't call when I'm caught in the thin line
And it's kinda hard to tell ya'
But on the blood of my city, I'm a' keep crawling up the barbed wire
Hold your guns higher, cause ain't none higher
Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
Y'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome
Smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stacking bread
And be ready for the armageddon
Try to come at the mob and get your body deadened",https://genius.com/Twista-legit-ballaz-lyrics

I jus' thought I'd let chu kno
When I'm rollin with a black Fo' Fo'
I ain't that nigga
Nah I ain't a gangsta, but kick it with board members and governors that love larry hoover
Niggas that'll do ya, Crackin a rifile over deciple have ya mama screamin' out (holla-lu-ya)
And No I ain't a Vice Lord, But I kick it with niggas that bang that shit to tha left
C-V-L love tha BL, them thug folks that love low, down with my click to tha death
And naw I ain't Black P Stone, but when I was getting production with Villain we was chillin'
South side, Swole brothas, who long ass braids, who real niggas stackin' millions to tha ceilin'
And naw I ain't a soul, but got into it with dollar and rocked pink with jack Vo Vo
Knew all them niggas when my raps flow so slow, befo' I was ridin black benzes on black Mo Mo's
And I got plenty of friends and relatives that still be all up in tha mix
Out chere up in tha streets', well fuck this rap shit nigga, I got guns you ain't gonna do shit
I ain't gonna be frontin' an fakin' and actin' petite all in my music, not uh, that's too lame
When it's on it's on, I pop a nigga, when you gone you gone
You finna be wiped of the earth like a memory, What's dude name?
And naw I ain't a killa, But I'll stank a motherfucker while I'm hooded if he pull it
Make a nigga bite tha bullet, hit em
With tha chrome cause I got tah show it's on to tha fullest
And naw I ain't chief, But I'm a motherfuckin' beast when it comes tha runnin' in tha streets
Ain't been on it in a minute cause a nigga getting money when I do it's cause a nigga gotta eat
And naw I ain't solid but I got tha up most respect fo' a nigga if he holla it
Or if he ride unda tha six I know he be tha shit to tha real g's, I gotta pay homed
And naw I ain't hard, but on god I'll push a niggas shit back and leave em scard
Get tha inferred beam then go steal em N steam em, stank a nigga then go put tha car in my garage
I spit crack you gotta pardon my berauge, uh lyrics I'm throwin' is countin' tha vesauge
Tha thieves wanna be thugs tryna put on fo tha streets
Some beats but ain't got heart up in tha mind
Quit lying you metamorphicly speakin' motha fuckas
Don't want it with real niggas that's out chere
Give a description of hellava gun but you don't wanna really feel it
From real triggas that's out chere
(cause it's out chere)

Naw I ain't a playa, but in my city all tha bitches holla at me like I'm tha mayor
Devistatin' while I'm say-uh, but if you wanna make it bigger than words I gotta spray her
And naw I ain't a pimp, but peel a hoe fo' a fimp and I walk with a limp
While I be smokin' on the hemp and at tha party bitches sayin' look at him look at him
And naw I ain't no mark or no coward, come at me you gonna get yo lil' heart devoured
We don't buckle easy tah threats we be comin' after next for techs for sex, money, and power
Been doin' tha Bid fo' so long that everybody around us talk shit
Can't do nothin but hate off tha money we make
If we don't come up off of rappin' we comin' up off bricks

Ya dig? Twista baby
Swagger like a dope boy, eye full of sky, all I see is turquoise
I be holdin and I'm rollin with the murk boys, stuntin with a pocket full of C-notes boy
Uh - it's the Twista, I'm back to work, when you see me talkin shit I get to act berserk
Treat a bitch like a nigga then smack her first then treat a nigga like a bitch and then snatch her purse
Ah, I still do it, listen to the beat and blow kill to it
Come up with some shit that make a nigga act up and a bitch wanna pop that pill to it
Chi-Town get buck, so don't fuck with them cause they will do it
Them VD's and Stones'll put it straight in your dome, I know conservatives'll make real fluid
Niggas yellin ""Almighty boy,"" hammer cocked back like The Mighty Thor
+Avengin+ the death of a night before, like the gangstas'll do when they ignitin war
And the Windy City dreadheads, spray up your house and leave your bed red
Lay out your casket with your bedspread and leavin everybody fuckin with the Greg{?} dead
Cause I cain't go; codeine, swag, cocaine flow
Feelin better when everything is in slow-mo, cheddar with a methamphetamine, no joke
Uh - gotta let you know boy, for the beef dope must be the antidote boy
I wear my gold like a pimp do, and I got the low-key demeanor of a coke boy

And my - swagger like a dope boy (swagger like a dope boy)...
Swagger like a dope boy, st-st-stuntin with a pocket full of C-notes boy
Swagger like a dope boy, like a dope boy, like a dope boy
Swagger like a dope boy, st-st-stuntin with a pocket full of C-notes boy
Swagger like a dope boy (swagger like a dope boy)

Halloween in the Phantom or a Ghost boy
Got my shooters in the club with the toast boy, gunnin if they catch you comin too close boy
Yes; hit his head with the back of the gun, Jordans on and they sportin the spectacular ones
Robbin jeans with the front up in the back of the tongue, and I got some drama for you if you askin for some
Uh, I know some niggas that'll rob for a livin (yea) I know some bitches that'll slob for the killin (yea)
Some people that don't wanna starve so they dealin with a cost for the peelin, shit is hard for a villain
I know some niggas that say they would, but I'd rather fuck with them cause their 'fetti good (yeah)
Steak and shrimp in first class flights and ride in Bentley coupes cause every day they jux
(Woo!) When the bitches see us comin they be lookin like ""There they go"" (they go)
(Woo!) When we see the police comin they be lookin like ""Where they go?"" (they go)
Stayin low in them Louis Vuitton shoes, Hermes belt with the Cavallis on
To another party and they polly strong, swag on them haters is what I be on
Uh - how I'm walkin in the shit that I be wearin, make 'em all wanna do it like me (like me)
Make the bitches start trippin on their man when they see me in the Gucci white tee (white tee)
In the whip so gross boy, I do thangs, two chains on the throat boy

Clappin,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Killers on deck, my semi's up to bat
My money on first, and my niggas in the back
Don't be surprised nigga if we start blastin
We get it, we get it, we get it clappin

I got the whole team ready for whatever
We gettin money so I could be never scared to face y'all
Killers on deck, money on first, semi up to bat
I guess it's a deadly game of baseball
Motherfuckers is snitchin and bitchin to authority
Who would do whatever to get you to court
These niggas juiced up on steroids
And this is the Mitchell Report
Performance enhancement drugs
Will make a nigga wanna take a chance with slugs
Try to stick a nigga up for extortion
Because you workin on a tip, they scandalous
Ain't no runnin over here takin nothin
Cause we gon' get to bustin if they don't explain they self
These killers late '80s babies
They don't honor shit, and yo' mayne in jail
Better come over here like a hyper asked for white
Don't be comin like a G and try to ask for turf
Semi-automatic'll send you to the afterlife
Hole in your dome lookin' like after-birth
Took a stand but you thought I woulda ran
If I didn't understand the plan because I can I can
Couldn't talk man-to-man
But now yo' momma cryin in the ambulance (""My baby!"")
When he was teachin I wasn't to hold you miss the preliminary
So now yo' body layin in the cemetery
Now your family reminiscin and sayin you shoulda listened
Whenever they lookin at yo' obituary
Told you we got the game on lock
We the champions of the league, we be ready to bleed
If you wanna get it crackin you're gonna be comin after when I bust
I make 'em back up  because I got the


The only way that I could be on my empire
Is if I was callin the shots like I'm the umpire
And I got the bitches callin the pimps sire
But if I go out on the block it's only gunfire
Thinkin you can make it to the ninth inning
But the whole game is another level and dimension
Like when the niggas put you on the pedestal
Attention quickly turn into medical attention
Plenty whips you probably be in
Cause you got that right block
Talkin shit like Ozzie GuillÃ©n
Cause you got that (White Sox)
'Til you suffer consequences and repercussions
Because of a homie who was snitchin and walkin with the law
Now you ain't tippin no more, but you be thinkin you hard
So you gon' try to take it from another nigga? Naw
Now you come up for the money like you Iron Man
When you should've just asked politely
Now I let it rip, cause I got the clip
Then my metal bitch, and I call her Aphrodite
Motherfucker I'm alpha mighty
You think I'ma let you just take my guap?
Round here we put a bullet in the head of pinch hitters
Nigga you can't take my spot
Cause I know you can't take my Glock
If you come at me I gotta make that pop
I get money, you put hundred dollar bills over the ones
Nigga you gotta fake my knot
You ain't gon' be able to make that stop
But I could make a bitch make that drop...",https://genius.com/Twista-clappin-lyrics

Blood N Blood Out,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Me and my closest road dog
Came up in an early age on the corner servin cane
Gang bangin and everythang
We some mutherf**kin gangstas
Broke to the right
Blood in Blood out brothers and we swore that was for life
Servin them keys and be clocking them g's and
We got whatever you need just a come and see me
Or my mutherf**king nug bout to show this city up show love
Or catch that bug from that nine millimeter slug
I broke bread with this nigga, i bust lead with this nigga
Heard he f**king with the feds
Can't believe it, not my nigga
Selling me for the cash, was he moving too fast
Talking behing my back to them damn hood rats
I'm going crazy ain't that a bitch
You try and get bitched and your closest rodey
Turns into a snitch
Just smiling and laughing in your f**king face
Went behind your f**king back hooking you with a f**king case
Going insane and i don't know what to think
Paranoid out my mind as i take another drink
Of that hennessy motherf**kin cognac
Got me reaching for my nine
Bout to peel this niggas cap
So i walked out the house
And i headed for the corner
I seen that nigga creeped up on him
Bitch yous a goner
Up that itchy to his temple why'd you try to f**k me Rodey
Started crying C-M-B
Nigga this ain't to New Jack City
And my name ain't no mutherf**kin Nino Brown
A tear roll down my cheek and i blew his brains on the ground
Sirens all around lights all in my face
Dick boys on the case so i headed towards the gate
Bitch freeze
Bitch please
Thats what i told them punk ass cops
All of a sudden i heard the shot
Couldn't believe i just got popped
Didn't drop, turned around, grapped my nine, then i pulled it
Started yelling just like fates a_?Bitch i took your f**king
Bulleta_?
Everything turned cold and got dark
I couldn't feel nathan but the beating of my heart
Blood in blood out
I thought that we was family
Can't believe he crossed me
Got to break him off G

Eight figures you fake twitchy niggas can't stop (that)
Jigga, Twista my nigga Timb on the hot track
How you gon' stop that? We can't be slowed
Niggas (?), look at your clothes
When I'm in crazy mode, three-eighty blows like
Maceo, leave acey holes
That's just Jay-Z doe, crazy flow
Rhyme great, dominate your radio
See'mon, get your gun, your mask and gloves
I don't ask for love, I blast 'em up
Respect my gangsta dude, or your life's in danger dude

Fuckin with Mag, nigga end up in a hospital
Sittin on the corner of the bed, sick cause of what I said to him
On a track star beef take it in the kitchen
Cookin MC's all niggas taste like chicken
Hittin 'em high, right in the ear
Slicin on 'em muh'fucker vampire style, I'm a bloodsucker
You turnin into a mad ducker, tellin ya dog
I'm at the Rucker with a bad Puerto Rican chick
Fat as my cash and she a dick sucker, get up outcha car
You ain't goin real far, see the chainsaw?
Breakin the law, like turnin a dyke
When it come to that man that just like Mike
I don't care what you like, I'll make you run in outer space
If you go to court man, only wish you got a case
For real, I'm fuckin faced on a hill of ice
Mag hot now nigga 50 G's the price

Timbaland good for that - {*beat plays, he scats*}
{*scatting*} - I invented that
Hear the hi-hat, hear the bassline on the track
Remember ""One in a Million"" when I left ya back
Producers sayin, ""How you get your sound like that?""
I don't know playa, I'm a creative cat
Got party people dancin to dis and dat
Got party people sayin, ""This a dope-ass track!""


Timbaland hit 'em with the um, ah-um, ah-um-ahh, you gon' do what?
Stop frontin you bumpin the new cut
Like a shoe ah, um ah-um ah, hit 'em in the gut
Twitchin and itchin to get up, I hit 'em up
With some skanless to vibe to and ride to
With the stanky inside you - listen to while a freak lickin you
Go on a bogus mission to, somethin you crip-walk in the kitchen to
Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
And all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick
You can let your mind cruise for miles
They can't tell no sucker who's allowed, with a strap on the mic
I'm thinkin how can I move the crowd, move the crowd

Ow ow ow-ow ah, shake wit me, shake wit me, shake wit me, shake..

Shake wit me, shake wit me

Remember when you first found me?
I was workin at Burger King
Now take a good look around me
Look at all these cars, look at all these girls
Why you always tryin to put down me?
Why you always tryin to put down me?
You get 'round your friends and try to clown me
Why you always tryin to pull that boo-boo?
I'm gettin tired of all that bullshit
Always talkin dis and dat
Your girls screamin, ""We looove him!""
See girls, they LOVE me

Scatta Gs Whitney Houston Tribute,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What? somebody told me Whitney Houston died
Can't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes
She was getting better now its really just blew aside
I still ain't got over Don Cornelius suicide
So where do I start it
Dearly departed
One of heavens angels for sure who was really an artist
Loving the way that my mama would say she could sing and the way it was magical
Ain't nobody like you
Nobody before you and nobody after you
Can never come near it
Not here in the flesh but wit us in spirit
So said to hear it
I'm chocking up while I come up wit these lyrics
And tho she blessed the earth and it's time to let heaven prosper
I still wish somebody was there to protect her
Who
Kevin Costner
Who
Clive Davis
Who
Bobby Brown
Her mama and her daughter Whitney is where God be now
Such a short time don't want it to be this way
But if she was here then she would probably say

If I should stay
I would only get in your way
So I go
But I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

I had my verse ready already
Holding my head cause its heavy
Reminiscing and missing Aaliyah, Left eye, Biggie, and Machiavelli
Now I just got the new that Whitney left me
Tho she never met me
I gotta show my respect and release this stress off my belly
Whitney
Houston
You one of heavens angels for real
Fame kills and I'm feeling like fuck a record deal
I'll work my nine to five tuck my pride and save up
Say a prayer for all the lost souls who gave up
Spread yo wings and fly where nobody can hurt ya
You at peace but for me it seem like the streets getting worser
Whitney
Yo voice is magic we can't help but to feel ya
When you was in the heartbreak hotel I was up in there wit you
We miss you
And could never forget you or the lessons you taught us
You should feel honored you remind me of my mama

Fat ass, my dick got hard
Soon as I took a look at the big brown thighs
Too sassy, bet you doin' nasty

Thick lips, ready for suckin'
And a nigga wanna fuck you when I listen to the way you talk
I'ma do it like this when I drop at you
Let you know that I'm the Twist' when I pop at you

Bending through the hood and I gotta pick her up
Is she over there bout this plane
I ain't trippin' baby girl, wanna fuck with a star
Then I bend her up on the door step
Body better than a muhfucka, low key
I remember when we rolled on fleets
Never had no sleep
She get the money while I count those keys
We comin' up from the dirt now
Slumped down in the Maybach curtain
Perfect, got Gs in her purses
Her complexion chocolate, Hershey's
Picture us with the tent up, bent up
Straight through the hood
Got the diamond on the wood all squazy
Smokin' weed so my eyes all lazy
See how the cops be lookin' all crazy
She my one double zero, one hunnid
Got my name tattooed on her stomach
And she always say my name when she cumin'
We be fuckin' on our money, stuntin'
See, we can drop the top in these cold days
Cause a nigga got a crib up in H-Town
When she see the penthouse, she gon' stay
Cause she fuck with a nigga, the long way


She go crazy for me and she was there by my side
When I ain't have nobody help (nope)
She was lookin' out for me, when I was fucked up
And I didn't have nobody else
Took me everywhere I needed to go
And then when I needed to eat
She would give me a hot meal
Holdin' me down and I love her for it
Gotta tell her how I feel
Whenever we goin' through a problem
She handle it with the highest of intellect (think)
A freak when she get that Rosé in her system
And I am so into that
Givenchy, Versace, Roberto Cavalli
You gotta give her that
Triss or Gohane, Alexander Wang
She gon' remember that
Who was there for you when you got into an accident
Or was hurt, not them!
Lookin' out for you when you was in federal custody
Or the penitentiary, in the dirt, Not them!

What's a muh'fuckin' poodle up against a red nose pit
When he trapped up in the park?
Niggas ain't no competition


Nigga catch a body faster than Maseratis
You would think Illuminati infiltrated
Niggas hated intimidated, affiliated be killin' with
Millimeters - hidin' bodies like the morgue
The type of shit you can't avoid


It's a never ending story
Of a cemetery fillin' military killin' men and bury
When they feel a scary individual up in the perimeter
Of a G like he a friend of every nigga, I
Ask him what do he want and where do he come from
What is he doin' up in the area, various questions
About the barriers and ?doin' no warriors?
And I can already tell of your character
Tell 'em all of the petty shit that you want
Still they gon' get up out of it cause they know you a hoe
Comin' up with the etiquette of a pro
But skill ain't gon' be astonishin', make you love what you owe
Go, for what you know, and I'm hopin'
Your friends don't miss and your kin don't trip
And your men don't slip and expand your grip
I get in your shit with extended clips
So if you see us come up in the vicinity and start lookin' around, then you know we're about to get busy
When your boys see me comin' and my nigga start gunnin'
I'mma have a nigga runnin' up out to 
It's prob'ly over product
Real type of shit that be leavin' a nigga shot up
Then I'mma try to hit him again if he got up
Leavin' the body layin', stayin' under the viaduct",https://genius.com/Twista-and-do-or-die-intro-lyrics
M.I.A.,Withdrawal,2015,"Niggas play hard
What can I say?
Kick shit off
M.I.A. (3x)
Kick shit off
M.I.A

Niggas play tough when they come through the scene
.44 cocked, cup full of lean
High top Chevy with a pocket full of green
Everybody talkin' loud without a killa on the team


They say they ready for war
But they don't even know they literature


Niggas steady just be talkin'
But unfortunately I don't hear 'em
Shorty I go in, only I know when
I be creepin' on a motherfucker
Stuntin' on 'em like a Forgiato rim, black brim!
It be so many actin' worthy and they actin' dirty
Like they got the birdy and they got the thirty
But when they hear drama, it be
'now you see him, now you don't'
When they hear the sound of the black MAC-10
Don't let your mouth get you into some shit
Your ass ain't gon' get you out of
Cause if you do, now what?
You might have to suffer the consequences
Of what can happen to a coward!
Fool he actin' like they don't know they'll do ya
All up in a muh'fucka face without a shooter
Don't know it's lil' homie that's with him, holdin' a Ruger
Niggas that shoot a nigga over a bag of buddha
Booyah! (Blaow!)
I come from an era where the killas used to
Have the hitters on the roof
Sippin' on liquor that's a hundred and eighty proof
A shot from the clip appear then disappear with a 'poof'
Ooh! (Zap!) You the type to kick it off
Then when they go up, you be gone from the scene
I want them niggas that's gon' put on for the team
When it go off they go get the chrome with the beam
Because I know",https://genius.com/Twista-and-do-or-die-mia-lyrics
