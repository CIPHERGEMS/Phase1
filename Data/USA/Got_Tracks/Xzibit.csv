My Name,Man vs Machine,2002.0,"This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
What up, X?
Just hit 'em

I float like Big's spirit in this bitch, I'm ghostly
Rush me, 'cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'll have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the can like 'Bis cop over me
To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets (*bang*) I finally got something to shoot at now

Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me and make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse?
I follow (Ugh!) hearse after hearse spit verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy ""Dance"" Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree
So now!

I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga, let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

Why do you hate me? I came from nothing
Blood, sweat, and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West Coast without me
Cut with the bullshit, I struggle for survival
And now you tryna act like my rival?
Watch what you say, partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life, nigga, it's not worth...
All the pain (All the pain), all the agony (All the agony)
All the horror (All the horror), all the tragedy (All the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now!
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day, you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK! you think you talking to?
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you!

I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could have been like Treach, poom-papped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I square dance 'cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, steady trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about (C'mon!)
(I) No gangsta, you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I should've crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
(X!) Pass me the weed
I'ma put my ashes out on his ass for the last time, man:
Watch your fucking mouth

I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga, let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

It's the last time, man
I'm through",https://genius.com/Xzibit-my-name-lyrics
Don’t Approach Me,Restless,2000.0,"[Intro: Xzibit & 
(Eminem)
]
Pssh, man, I need a lighter, man 
(Right here!)
Yeah… whassup, Slim? 
(What's crackin'?)
Hit this shit 
(Shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today)
Psh, is that right? 
(
What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that
Because we're in the spotlight, or whatever, that
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won't retaliate?
)
Protect my motherfuckin self, by any means necessary 
(Right)

‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Being underrated gave me time to create
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate
Millionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk and shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows
You know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home
But my baby mama hate my guts and can't stand me
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up?
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
Fuck that! This the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch?
Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down
‘Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child

It's like, every day I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive survivin' this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the Sun
Whether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one
No bullets? You're so full of shit
This clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit
Don't tell me 'bout the show business shit, I know what this is
Bitch

‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

This ain't business, this is personal, bitch
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fifth
Shuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the fifth
Yo, Em, it's time to get serious with it
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit rain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth
To my niggas who never seen it, I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like Tony Soprano: who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke – that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn 'til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit

So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself, a front door with 12 locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that! I protect myself with these 12 shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face
And it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit
Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with 
Spin
, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters blow it out of proportion
Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans, just for tryna stand on his porch
And I'm the bad guy, ‘cause I don't answer my door, like, ""Hey! Hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!""
Sometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you
It's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you",https://genius.com/Xzibit-dont-approach-me-lyrics
X,Restless,2000.0,"Yeah! Ladies and gentleman
Broadcastin' live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bouncin', c'mon

The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keepin' my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin' up and down my dick like the stock exchange

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefer, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

What an event, we hardcore a hundred percent
Makin' it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, and scream

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

So there you have it - A-B-C, D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant, Xtrordinary, Xciting, X-a-lotta
XO with a little bit of Xtacy
X-ing your bitch-ass out if you tryin' to test the G
And what's the recipe? Xcalibur weaponry
And we shoot Xceptionally
That there is hot - X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks

Paparazzi,At the Speed of Life,1996.0,"Yes, 1996 marks the beginning of a new era
The dysfunctional member of the Alkaholiks family
It’s Xzibit!

Sometimes I wonder if it’s all worth my while
Xzibit stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle
And I could feel it as a child growing up
The niggas that was real
And the niggas that was scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigger-talk, you ain’t killin' shit
It’s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with
I don’t believe the hype or buy woof tickets
Nigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket
I guess that’s why we never kick it
A lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit
How many niggas do you know like this?
Always claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch
It don’t make sense, either you’re a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryna play the part—like that!

It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

See, I don’t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it
Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue
Tryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck
And that’s deep; how deep? It’s deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted
Now, how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard?
I'm pullin' that card, and saying ""Gin, mothafucka!""
Flowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka!
I'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death
From the West, puttin' whole counties to the test
It’s all in perspective, 
breaker 1-9 copy
This is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi

It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

Niggas smoke stress and crossdress, but I just play the back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck ’em all how I feel
I made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal
Therefore you look and stare like it’s magic
But too much of anything can make you an addict
Whenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate
But wait! Who dares to cross this path?
Yo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath
So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with
Smokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit
He-he, and keep it all in perspective
Carbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi
Once again, it's the Likwidation crew
And we return at you like this

It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)",https://genius.com/Xzibit-paparazzi-lyrics

It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go
Niggas gettin' knocked out is part of my show
Let them know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box
With my fresh pressed khakis and a slingshot
So heatbox all day in a nigga face
And all you bitches see the dick that you should've ate

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it

Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone
Got the spot blown, (Boom) Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head 'til his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a ""Black Cop""
X and Es, out for the cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uhh, give it to y'all, in ""Any Given Sunday""
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now)
Blow it down hooker bounce, 
come off the ropes like J. Snuka
(X: Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck with it
Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it

J-McEnroe, cam smashin', party crashin'
I eat MCs like a ration
I'm sockin' niggas in their goatees
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 Gs, counting ten Gs
'Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell weed?)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds 'cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquor by the gallons

Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
If I'm too drunk to walk, I'll rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference
For instance, ""21 and Over"" set your clocks back (Tick-tock-tick)
Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one
, we still young guns that's Restless
(Thirty niggas, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin' guest list

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it

Some call that a problem but I call it a gift
Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)
Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory
A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct
Bitch niggas continue to floss and lip-sync
And I'mma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope
Don't make my Desert Eagle barrel touch the back of your throat
Always approach niggas that's known for killin your folks
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction
Funny style, and these niggas ain't laughin
Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero
Think life is a video for ""Last Action Heroes""
Face the price you pay for the games you play
When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta

Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up

Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed
When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift
Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock
Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop
It's the best thing crackin my nigga
Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver
From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags
Earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas
Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)
You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)
Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket
Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid
Drastic measures we take just to get by
For all the shit you gotta go through to get high
Stand by, do or die for the WestCoast!
Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers

Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up

Tell y'all people to call my people
Recognize all men are not created equal
I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through
Only the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!)
When I get through the World'll be a better place
A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface
Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace
Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit
Or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip
My transcript number one up in this conference
It's nonsense, all y'all niggas want is conflict
Only associate with pros and the convicts
Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch
And then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle
You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle

Get your walk on, get your head tight

All these bitches and women—son, please be selective

By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us
When your neck is on the line, stand ground then bust
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked
Ready to rock then shake the spot, the Foundation

You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers
Who forever smoke bud, so it's probably in your blood
Realize you can only run the streets so long
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong
Same shit different day, it's the same ol' song
If the time ever comes that I meet my match
Take control of my assets, fuck startin' from scratch
Take care of your mother, keep yourself on track
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back
Beware of the serpent
 'cause there's a time in life
The mothafucker will strike and try to make you loose sight
Don't be a fake motherfucker tryin' to keep shit real
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill
Son if you ever pull heat then use it
If you got a chance to walk away then do it
Total domination takes full concentration
In all situations, a solid foundation (yeah yeah)

You are the foundation, beginning of a new generation
I remember hospital hallway, pacin'
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine
Only to find that yours looked like mine
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time
In this life you can't press stop then press rewind
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind..
..no man, have your own plan, expand your mind
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs
This is nothing but love via sattelite Muggs
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife
Be prepared for the worst, but expect the best
No matter where life takes you come home to the West
Survival takes more than just gats and guns
That's words to live by from a father to a son

End of the World,Urban Ammo 2,2011.0,"Sometimes people, people would get you down
Then get back up, it's not the end of the world
Yeah
Although it may feel like that sometimes
It's so simple, simple, as one, two, three
Back on your feet, you gotta hold your head high
Let 'em know we right here, forever
We ain't going nowhere till the end of the world

Ladies and gentleman, introducing the most impressive
I plan on shaking the planet until I'm convalescent
I never count my blessings, I only count the cost of living
It's hard to buy everything they sell on television
My momma cried religion, I only got my dreams
One day they gonna be reality, can't rip off the seam
If I could just achieve, and not just make-believe
But anybody else is gon' create what only I can see


Standing tall, never fall, after all
My pride is all I got, respect is all I want
And I will never crawl, this a race, so I run
Far from where I begun, look at the man that I've become
Look up in the sky, as long as the sun rise
I'll be on this rhyme, while you waiting for the signs
You mistaken, if you think you takin' what's mine
In a world where the blind lead the blind, I'll be fine
Just like the world keep spinning, I'ma keep winning
Either you rollin' with it or you choose to go against it
Your thoughts are so offensive, so I expose intentions
My offence against opposition is so impressive
So here's a message to all of my competition
My words in this composition, reflects the way I'm livin'
Expecting something different when doing the same thing
Is the true definition of insane


Let them know we right here forever, we ain't going nowhere till the end of the world",https://genius.com/Xzibit-end-of-the-world-lyrics
What It Is,Urban Ammo 2,2001.0,"Get down, turn around, show me what you got
You a pow-pow, Juggernaut, take it up a notch
Oh my god, wow, take 'em out, let me take a shot
I'mma sit down, get a drink, let you work it out
Step back, 
I can nearly put it in your mouth
Have a cocktail, never fail, turn your body out
We can set sail, overseas, you cannot pronounce
All the places you will see, currency amounts
Fluctuating, better learn, quickly how to count
We can pass out, wake up, make another drop
Got a pornstar appetite, get it while it's hot
How you ticking like a clock, tie your panties in a knot
Let me crush that, rush that, let me come again
It's a must that I touch that, where do I begin?
In the back? In the front? Damn, show me what it is
Fast lane, with a fast dame, only way to live

Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
Show me what it is

You a bad chick, you deserve every single dollar
And your assets make me wanna come and do the honors
Forecast says, you gon' have some money raining on you
With the chance that it's gonna last all the way until tomorrow
Cash-in, go and put a price tag on it
Cause your ass, I could probably fit a mic stand on it
Refrigerator, or mattress and a nightstand on it
Make a nigga wanna go take a loan, finna own it
You flaunt it, can't lie about that
When you're lying down flat and you're arching up your back
Crazy, face, crazy, taste, crazy, I save you
Practice making babies, maybe
I'm getting a lil' ahead of myself
But I know I put it down better than anyone else, does
But this ain't about love, this about
Two pills, a bottle of champagne and a hot tub

Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
Show me what it is",https://genius.com/Xzibit-what-it-is-lyrics

What U See Is What U Get,40 Days & 40 Nightz,1998.0,"And so it was written, and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory
And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying
""Babylon the great has fallen
Has fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every foul spirit
And a cage of very unclean, and hateful men""

Yeah, what you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time
Only concerned with what is mine, divine
Never monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line
Holdin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)
Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep
Don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)
This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth
Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this

Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers
Willies, thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day
Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving

What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor
I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black
Take your breath like an asthma attack
Just a slave like Flavor Flav, ""You're blind to the facts""
Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee
Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally
Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P
Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)
A whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me
Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree
Roundhouse to the mouth right
And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright
I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red
Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread
Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead
Came crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it

What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

The year everybody start to rush
Swingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush
I crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust
I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight
Start to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work
Heavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt
Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt
Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt
Get cut from the belly up (What?)
I break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane
I'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things
Material things, protected by the underground kings
Who rule the land with an iron fist
The Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)
You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam
Cause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?

Spit Shine,8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture,2002.0,"I'mma clean this whole shit out like colonics
With words put together better than Sony Electronics
King of the jungle, humbly stay honest
Eat with the lions, swim with piranhas
Gasoline the scene, strike the match
Inferno, I'm too thorough, nigga, so stand back (Whoosh)
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhyme
And make my career take an incline
I'm strict with knives, straight with razors
Good with grenades, great with gauges
Been around the world on a million stages
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes
I had guns before thugs was in fashion
I mashed out before niggas knew mashing
I knew terror before the plane started crashing
I got punch lines and niggas ain't laughing

I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend your self
Move like I move and live life long
Can't move up if ya heart not strong
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shit's mine
Every time I spit I shine

Cocksucker, I preach what I practice, back shit up
Wrap this rap shit up, still acting up
Get found in a trunk of an Acura
Y'all suck like jail and Dracula
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred
Straight stone faced don't fuck with gay shit
So I guess that means I can't fuck with you now
Two down, let off, vacate to new town
It feel like Bishop and Juice now
Got a flame thrower that'll burn big holes through your goose down
Rough sound, same strong background
Been on black, the big boys laying chips down
My whole train of thought is
To body any mothafucker with problems and not get caught
I was blessed with life but I curse to death
I'mma spit til my very last breath - fuck y'all!

I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend your self
Move like I move and live life long
Can't move up if ya heart not strong
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shit's mine
Every time I spit I shine

Let me get a three second look, I hit a million dollar target
You ain't came up yet, well nigga let me show ya
Come across dope like planes and boats
Like balloons filled with coke down a Mexican's throat
You ever seen a man get smoked, they shit on they self
Their body shake for a second then it gets dissected
For evidence of the weapon and the people involved
Let one nigga talk, everybody gettin' caught for sureo'
I say that to say this (what?)
If you can't handle the time then ride the bench
Might as well touch ya tail and jump the fence
Castrate ya self, expose the bitch
X go head up, but fuck, never ran from it
I got a gauge with buck shot that you can't stomach
You ain't a killa, you a album filler
You ain't a soldier, you a rap promoter, game over!

I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend your self
Move like I move and live life long

Napalm,Napalm,2012.0,"Yeah, you thought that this was over
Thought you got away with murder
Watch me murder my deserters
This is congress secret service
Got your epirdermis calling
From the toxins in the water
Use the oxygen to slaughter
This is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits
Still suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch
Now it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance
Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch

I'm okay now, bring the napalm
I'll fly over and blow you away
No more sunshine, no more playgrounds
I'll fly over and blow you away now
There's no glamour, no guts, no glory
When I fly over, and blow you away
Blow you away now
The fuck can you say now?
I'm loading my napalm

The last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go
Camouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo
HIV, Polio, positive identity
Ashes of evil because we can't believe the trinity
Homeland Security, false is superiority
Fuck your intentions and big plans for my community
I ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?
I'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat


I just wanted to live my life like the common man
Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends
Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right
Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights
And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all
Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn
I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Aerosol arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse
The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite
All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments
The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious
This is for the populous, population genocide
Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize
Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise
When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind
But hey, hey

You better get ready for the war

A shotgun fanatic, who right back at it
You get mopped and dropped, like a filthy habit
X snatch and grab it, got you hopin' I fail
‘Cause if I fail you'd be happy like a faggot in jail
I'm full retail, guaranteed to sell
In my jet black McLaren, with my mademoiselle
I'm strong-arm steady, you fragile and frail
You think you ready for them steady niggas? I can't tell
Sex sells, so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball
You gettin' shut down, soon as I touch down
Bust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down
Fully automatic, spittin' rounds with no sound
Break down your whole regime, like an M-16
Make sure the chamber in the barrel is clean
And the spring that's connected to the firin' pin
That's connected to the trigger, when I squeeze it again, begin

Look, my top of the world, the best of the best
King California, LAX
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects
One man, one gun, how the West was won, sing

It's so frustratin', so many hatin'
Somebody gon' make me break the law
But I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'
You better get ready for the war

Hit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate
Make the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate
I ride through my city, like a presidential candidate
LAX, Phantom double R, and accelerate
Stack, build, elevate,
 crash through the prison gate
Generation hate, appetite to eliminate
X-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate
Traffic contraband, yeah, banned through the interstate
Got a sick flow, didn't know? Let me demonstrate
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate
The left hand lands, and the right hand devastates
Half part of your face, replaced with a metal plate
Irate, get snatched to a better place
Let the detec's decorate with the yellow tape
Detonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake
In Brazil, with a half mil' in the briefcase

Look, my top of the world, the best of the best
King California, LAX
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects
One man, one gun, how the West was won, sing

Here is some one who stood up
Here is...
Yeah! Hennessy for Everyone Music proudly presents
Xzibit, movin' at the speed of life
Yeah! Check it

It took a long time comin but we waited
Xzibit went from underrated, to now most anticipated
Never would of thought that I would rock your set
And get love and respect without no special effects
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed
Thinkin how you like to see the next man bleed
Tryin to glorify greed; livin life at ridiculous speed - indeed!
The main goal's to achieve, to succeed
Have it laid out for your seed
But the world gets colder every day by day
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A
Trying to find piece of mind is like tryin to find a gold mine
It just won't happen, no time for relaxin
Real soldiers of fortune the front line of the action
So never show a nigga what you packin (You know what I'm sayin?)
It's too much weight to be jugglin
Who do you picture when you think about strugglin
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin
Or niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin

Movin'', yeah!
Yes, movin'
At the speed of life

And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind
And when I die, niggas still recite these lines
To rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down
The underground! to upper echelon and beyond
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond
Nigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blonde bitch
Mackin to Farrakhan, run game like a marathon
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone
It's the law of the land, a straight modern day babylon!

Movin', yeah! Yeah! Like this
Like this, at the speed of life
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!

Xzibit lookin at the earth thru wide angles
I find a stairway to heaven in the city of lost angels
Where small situations turn to heavy altercations
With a heavy-ass price cause, niggas don't fight no more!
Before hip-hop was all about drama
Anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madonna
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma
Just me and my bottle, we shall lead not follow
Emcees be full of shit but they style be hollow
It seems you've bitten off more than you can possibly swallow
Just a day in the life of a man named X
Only blunts and latex for the opposite sex
You see niggas comin through to smoke out and pay respect
Ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything
Whatever they bring in any shape form or fashion
I live to the fullest and rock rhyme with a passion
But in the meanwhile if worse comes to worst
Bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first
Yeah! we got it locked down tight
Xzibit bring truth to the light shit is movin, at the speed of life

1983,Napalm,2012.0,"I think we all have these moments in our life, where we say
Or do things
And we're so sorry for them, really
It's not the way we would have wanted it to come out
Umm, let's face it, this is real life
And this is the thought that was captured from me
That words only share a small portion of the vision that they give witness too

I had to write this in blood, because the ink wouldn't stick
I sold five to six million but, yo, that ain’t really shit
It was supposed to be different, we were supposed to ride out, 
But too much shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth
Then the steady game form but very soon fell apart, 
‘cause when you just doing all, with no the loyalty in your heart, 
It’s like catching Alzheimers on all these niggers forgetting where they’re coming from
And they’re slowing down, wait a minute, what we’re running from?
This what we’re supposed to do, here’s where we’re supposed to be, 
I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery
But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract
Small price to pay just to take a piece of mind back
My back, backfire, assassination of my character
Just to make some millions off of America
My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child, 
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out
Even though my father loved me, I ain’t seen him in a while
Had to fight my baby momma, bitch, give me my nigga now
‘cause he's running out of time and I need him to understand
The way a superior man had build a brand
Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay to Uncle Sam
I’m surviving cause the mind’s eyes quicker than the hand

Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine
I just wanted to join her
Nah Mr. Joiner, you get to California, I got something for you to do, it was like I was anointed
Resurrected, found my purpose
I remember meeting Dre, being nervous when I would kick my verses
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it
Got a call from Paul,
 told me shit isn’t working
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person
He probably told Em, and by the way did he said it unapologetic twisted made about him
I see Slim and he said he didn’t recognize me
Was it that or did he let another man define me
I don’t know, but now I gotta get this all behind me
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggers blindly

I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles
Blood relatives I could turn to when I’m feeling trouble
And talk about my struggles
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone with different females
And this is such a such, nephew, tell 'er, what’s up?
Ain’t even ask about Tremayne and Gatlyn , growing up
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle
Self medicated numb, but I'mma feel it tomorrow
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now the pain is gone I got my second win
Only the strong live long, you better settle in
I’m fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win
1983, that’s when my journey begins
I searched every world for strength, only to find it within
This for me and my kin, still dying to live
Living life to the fullest 'till I see you again",https://genius.com/Xzibit-1983-lyrics

Now print this in your industry books
If it wasn't for crooks you niggas'd still sport the Jordache look
Hit the switch, front to back, side to side
Natural born killers never let shit slide
Never rely on the next man to swing for you
A rock and a hard place, duck between the two
And y'all bitches just somethin' to do, don't get it twisted
You're easy like Sunday mornin' and shopliftin'
It go simple as that, I'm never givin' half to a rat
I'd rather bam to your face with a bat
You get tied down to the tracks
Used to make a living cookin' coke to crack, now I can't turn back
This is holocaust rap nigga, overreact
And I'mma bring it to yo' chest like an asthma attack
Ya heard? Yeah

It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome

Movies,Napalm,2012.0,"Maybe it's time I change religions on you
Turn a Christian to a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em Catholic Ronnie been it
Sippin' red wine inside the Pentagon
Writin sinister lines 'til all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watchin' ESPN
My sick porno obsession's got me watchin' these lesbians
I'm a sick fuckin' psychotic bastard
The mic is my sword, the booth is your casket
I'm sittin' inside a classic six-four with the ratchet
Throwin' up west side is my worst fuckin' habit
All these snap backs and egos
Eyes lookin' through peep holes is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
I'm livin' my destiny, poppin' pills, high as fuck
Fuckin' bitches in the club, holdin' my Spades bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way, I'm the star of this motherfuckin' movie

They say I got a suicidal tendency murderin' all my enemies first
It ain't no question, the thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic'll turn your Hummer to a hearse
Worse case scenario, pipe bomb your burial
They gonna have to bury you twice
This scary cat on this night life
The Gulf stream private but the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk
Heavy chain, light wrist, pay cash for everything
That white bitch (she got it, she got it) that's my words to Orenthal
Sixteen and a two liter got it lookin' like motor oil
I'm leanin' hard in that flat black turbo charged coupe on twenty-fours, pedal to the floor
One hunnid shots at a nigga, still got plenty more
Slim The Mobster and my Israeli-made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfuckin' movie

Lights, cameras, action, niggas ready to shoot (shoot)
But these ain't lights and cameras pointed at you (you)
Block off the scene 'cause your scenes don't move me
We'll turn your block into a motherfuckin' movie

Back When We Were Kings, we were the Lord of the Rings
Requiem for a Dream
, smokin' my Soylent Green
Now I know why the Cage Bird sings, there's no more Men of Honor
I'm Iron Man in my suit of armor, runnin' from karma
The Good Die Young, No Country for Old Men
There Will be Blood deeper than Leviathan
And my Platoon full of Bad Lieutenants
X-Men, Expendables, Bad Company criminals
Crush Grooves with a Kangol, Serpent And The Rainbow
48 Hours to Kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Braveheart, Battleship, Devil's Advocate with the Passion of Christ, It's A Wonderful Life
Miami Vice, what to get right
It's Midnight in the Garden the Good and Evil
I Crash Ordinary People, Lethal Weapon without four sequels
Survive the Hunger Games
The Gods Must be Crazy, Ricochet through the Purple Rain
Because The Devil Wears Prada
The Dead Presidents can turn a Goodfella to a Godfather
Animal House, Stand and Deliver The King's Speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Ocean's Eleven if All Dogs go to Heaven
The Silence of the Lambs, Son of Sam, Seven, I am Legend
Fuck this New Jack City, I'm on the Midnight Express
With this American History X, yes

Off the dome and I'm talkin' slick as petroleum
'Cause I don't fuck with pens 'less I'm ballin' on some linoleum
Niggas preachin' hate from Napoleon
I'm slowly throwing salt in my game like pourin' some sodium on a goalie
But, homie, I'm only in it for the cash sport
Think you fucked the world? Somethin' like a pornstar with a passport
With Officer Walker and my side mirror in
He don't like me 'cause I'm dark as a Nigerian
Rockin' a lot of jewelry and smart as a librarian
And the look in my errogant eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before, don't ignore it again
Two hands on the Nine, like a quarter to ten, dude
Life's a hooker, the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars, thug lords and judges tryna to court case me
Lord, Save Me, it's Scorsese, a movie

Some niggas is better left alone
I place you underneath the very ground you walkin' on
And ain't no children in this motherfucker, drop your tone
Ain't got no business even fuckin' with no microphones
So yo, it's me against the world
, and ain't got shit to lose
My heavy artillery built to make the masses move
I carry tools that'll pick you up and out your shoes
Xzibit bringin' new meanin' to alcohol abuse
I wanna fall up in the spot where all the bitches at
Holdin' somethin' heavy to help you straighten out your back
A couple of drinks and I bend you over the kitchen sink
So what, you think I owe you somethin' bitch for fuckin' me?
(Bitch) Get a grip, misery love company, check it
Xzibit show you the difference between real life and makin' a record
Makin' the moves and connections that you never expected
What good is money and the fame if you never respected
Check it out

You know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets

Don't be actin' like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin' with X
You know, we roll so fuckin' deep

'Cause you're actin' like your shit don't stink

Yo, I ain't afraid of them fuckin' invisible gats
You always bringin' out in your raps
My shit'll quickly make you fold and collapse
My goal to strictly takin' over the map, by any means
Hustle and make more tracks than a heroin fiend
Keep my enemies on a first name basis
And hate them niggas like a skinhead racist
Chuck Taylors and fat laces
Stompin' hoes through y'all turf
I hurt worse than actual childbirth
A chick can suck my dick 'til the big squirt (Ah-Ah!)
The song work, so ain't no playin' wit us
Findin out where you rest your head and I'm sprayin it up
The remains that's left behind can probably fit in a cup
You pressin' your luck, you makin' yourselves easy to touch
I'm from the home of the hit 'em up, only two ways
You droppin' some shells or you get 'em up, back in the days
There was a time there was this woman that I want to keep up
But nowadays when I see you I'm just tryin' to fuck
So check it out

You know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets

Always droppin' straight heat so stay the fuck out of the way
You know, we roll so fuckin' deep
(Round after round in the middle of the street niggas)
'Cause you're actin' like your shit don't stink
Y'all ain't fuckin' with Dre

Thangs just ain't the same since he came out
Two thousand and one, came blew the game out
I heard you was hot, blew your flame out
And got the nerve to believe you hold the same clout
I thought I told you, keep my name out of your fuckin' mouth
(But Dr. Dre!) See that's exactly what I'm talkin' bout
That shit right there, that's all day long
Just don't stop, I gots to be alone at the top
Forever ready loaded and locked, with niggas that'll circle yo' block
And let 'em pop 'til some bodies get dropped
It's Doc Holiday in the flesh
(Still) Hold it down, represent, resurrect the West
(Still) Holdin' ground, touchin' down, with my nigga X
(Still) Send a couple through yo' chest if you disrespect
Dr. Dre comin' back (shit) I never left
The number one ranked highest paid celebrity guest
That's eight digits, motherfuckers

You know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets

Don't be actin' like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin' with X

Best of Things,Restless,2000.0,"I was voted most likely to have a psychiatric evaluation
Let's start the process of elimination

The bandula, six-shooter to your suit coolers

This hollow point lead gon' be your last meal
Say your prayers, say your graces
Pieces of your face is found in a hundred different places
Huh, so what we lookin like? We tryin to see some hoes to fuck tonight
And you just tryin' to see the afterlife
Make a decision before we have a head-on collision
Makin me spend the rest of my life in prison
See I can only play the cards I was given
Multiplication division whatever you got to break mines off
Like the U.S. government did to Microsoft
Like Xzibit in some pussy with the lights turned off, it's like

I'm just livin' to fulfill my dreams
I'm just tryin' to have the best of things
None of y'all can't take shit from me

So I'mma ride 'til the wheels fall off
While all the rest get weak and go soft
Your petite style, can get you beat down
My heat's loud, have you huggin' on the street now

Niggas keep askin me how does it feel
How does what feel? Not havin to scrape for a meal?
Not bein locked down to a fucked up deal?
The biggest man in Los Angeles is not Shaquille
We had to reinvent the wheel, draft new blueprints
Made a whole album, spent half what you spent
Then sent the rest to my people to invest with it
Custom fitted, if you want it nigga, come and get it
And I suggest you bring a million niggas runnin' wit it
Split it, feel it, hit it it's hot, look
I ain't gon' stop 'til everybody's shot
Muammar Khadafi's the dot, X mark the spot
With an infrared to your head, left for dead
Fuck the feds, flee the country then grow some dreads (ya mon)
I suggest you keep your distance, for instance, the same distance
It takes to get to the next solar system, motherfucker

I'm just livin' to fulfill my dreams
I'm just tryin' to have the best of things
None of y'all can't take shit from me
Life's a bitch she ain't fuckin for free
So I'mma ride 'til the wheels fall off
While all the rest get weak and go soft
Your petite style, can get you beat down
My heat's loud, have you huggin' on the street now

Strike one, when a nigga talkin shit with his hands down
Strike two, gettin caught in the wrong place with your pants down
Strike three, tryin to fuck with the D-O-double-G
D-R-E, or any of my Alkaholik family
Huh, Xzibit turn your vital signs to a straight line
Never seen a dog bite and bark at the same time
Restless, rugged, never relaxed
Permanently owe you motherfuckers backs like tax
Baseball bats and bricks upside of your head
Homey still gettin swole off water and bread
I got this, retaliation, for any situation I'm facin'
And leave the stage with a standin' ovation, it's like

I'm just livin' to fulfill my dreams
I'm just tryin' to have the best of things
None of y'all can't take shit from me

Show me how you regulate
Hold up, wait, that shit's fake
Get these niggas up out my face
Shake the room, bend the spoon
Turn this up now, stay in tune

Take your time you might arrive too soon


Bring that back, what was that?
Oh my lord, she got back
So precise, so deattached
Oh my God, who is that?

Hibernate, consummate
Man was made to procreate
My estate, generates
As if my family name was Gates
Days of grace, lift big plates
Why be good nigga, go be great
Hit the breaks, crack them crates
Have you on the run goin state to state
Contemplate, demonstrate
Mind over mayhem, no mistakes
Lift some weights, eat some steaks
But you don't really want that face to face
But let's relax, check your traps
Don't let yo' concentration snap
I love the way she arch her back
Like how a muh'fucker 'sposed to handle that?

Breath control, touch yo' soul
Just maintain don't lose control
Participate, congratulate
Cause everything else'll be seen as hate
Remain in place, the same mindstate
Get off yo' ass and celebrate
Congregate, associate
Don't fuck yo'self procrastinate
Dilate, to an all time great
Calculate the next move I make
Crack the safe, keep that ace
In my waistband just in case
I'm no rat can't run yo' race
Not too good don't fit my taste
I love the way she make that shake

Cinnamon, with a taste of honey, it ain't funny

I know what she like, she act right
She act like she ain't gon' survive the night
Without my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast
I see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash
Walk around naked witcha beautiful ass
Who the fuck taught ya how to move that fast?
It took time to perfect the stroke, by any note
Maybe we really don't need to drink and smoke
And just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin
Bang on your G-spot 'til your (voice is missin)

I don't want to love, you
I just want to fuck, you
You should bring your friends, through
I'll fuck you and them, too


I work hard when I'm breakin your back, my lil' nyphomaniac
Suck it, swallow it, down the hatch
It ain't a game when she givin me brain, she doin her thang
I'm up all night but I never complain
I don't, waste no time with makeup lines
I just, look in her eyes and read the signs
A lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm
Cause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city
Just look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair
She get off too quick, when I pull on her hair
I'm the only nigga that can take you there
I ain't the only one fuckin and I don't care!
She come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin
And then, that's where the party begins
And I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks
Baby get on top, and don't you stop!


I know you love the way I'm diggin it out
I know it's hard to talk with all this dick in your mouth
Menage-a-trois, for moi, let's figure this out
I drink a Hennessy fifth and sweat the shit out
She don't gotta cheat cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin a fuck, we fuck all night
Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind
Get in line, bitches stay on the grind, cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs
Ain't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty
Ass in the air like a pass to Grassi
It's a, thin line between hoes and women
And close my dick with a hat and change the linen

Been this way since I was fourteen
And like this I been runnin shit without the use of Sportscreme
Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay

I just wanna thank you, for bein around
And patiently waitin and holdin me down
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me
I just wanna thank you, for bein a fan
And watchin me grow from a boy to a man
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me

You 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard
With all of these rappers pullin' triggers and flippin' birds
I know it sound absurd, cause they don't tell the truth
They prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth
But yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above
No matter my faults still continue to show me love
Naw I ain't perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same
I play chess not checkers but this is not a game
And this is not a song, and this is not a verse
It's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed
Spent the first half of my life, thinkin that I was cursed
Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse
That wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade
Makin it what it's 'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me
All these people approachin me, don't even know the half
I could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn


My son's 11 now, I got to see him grow
Makin his free throws, the way he laughin at the show
Yo he remind me of me, when I was ridin bikes
He gon' be taller than me, he got my mother's height
But yo you know the difference, between me and them others
They say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers
I coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball
Mind of Metallica, motherfuck 'em and ""Kill 'Em All""
I used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets
I used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef
Most of my homies is gone, restin in peace
Some'll never see release from custody of police, but me
But nah my little dude get to go to private school
And I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do
That's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you
Support from you and yours, thank you for gettin me through, true


We buried Proof today,
 it really broke me up
To see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?
Media made me angry, I had to soak it up
The future is fragile never promised to none of us
Hittin so close to home, but what I focused on
Is how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone
We never walk alone, although sometime it seems
That nightmares go hand in hand with livin out dreams
So let me take this time, from my struggle my grind
To let you know that I appreciate you by my side
It's been a long ride, a lot of long nights
A lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice
A soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight
I never had a plan B, I never lost sight
That's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill the mic
It's for my fans that's ridin with Xzibit for life, RIGHT!


Thank you, for lettin me breathe
For lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh
Two little words, y'all never get to hear enough
Knahmsayin? Yeah that, hehe..
Yes.. the return
Uh-huh.. breathe!",https://genius.com/Xzibit-thank-you-lyrics

I heard the O.G.'s they don't hit
And I'm the only one left from the West that you can't fuck with
But lately I've been feelin like Will Smith
Why bother with rap when I can get 20 mill' on a flick?
Y'all niggas just started some shit, the underdog
Makin songs for them hogs, and them Bloods and Crips
For the shah by the mall with a Muslim scent
After all, who do you call to rock your shit? {""break 'em off somethin""}
Bust the ghetto bird, circle above, reminisce
Of the dust kicked up
, the dirt swept under the rug
Duct tape, ski-mask, tape recorders
Cue K's, ready to blaze and bakin' soda
First learned how to cook in a coffee pot
Made the block get hot like lava rock
Got love for the block cause I came from that
But I ain't afraid to go right back {""break 'em off somethin""}

Now how many really gon' ride, when the war start?
Eaten alive by these hollow-tip darts
My 12 gauge'll tear you apart, don't get caught at the light
The house party or the neighborhood park
Mr. X marks the spot then pops the mark
Turn your whole neighborhood to a parkin lot
I paid the cost to be the boss
And will do my time standin up 'til I get an appeal
These weapons too real to conceal, so why bother
Semper fidelis, I learned from my father
I always stay faithful to myself and grow
But when I catch that ass after the show - {""break 'em off somethin""}


I'm slick and slippery
On a high-speed chase all the way to the victory
Y'all niggas is stone cold mysteries
Too weak, can't stand in the ring with me
Put a pussy back in his place,
 
straightlaced
With a Strong Arm Steady gang up in your face
I run a race with the West to my back
While you're the reason why they say niggas in the West can't rap
Ever since the white Concourse 'Llac, I've been unmatched
A avalanche in the hood on attack
Just hardcore actual facts, never wait
Just react when them killers come at you with gats
Had to dig the knife out of my back, now I'm back on track
Hittin laps, 'bout to widen the gap yo
It ain't the long fall from the top that got 'em
It was the sharp sudden stop at the bottom, haha {""break 'em off somethin""}",https://genius.com/Xzibit-criminal-set-lyrics

Everyday lead to late nights
Bitches on my neck like a vampire appetite
Homie, pass me a light, I got that master kush
Gave birth to you bastards, told your momma to push
Now here you are, I see you're feeling strong
My prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long
Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate
I wave my banner of peace, I hope you take the bait
Pussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face
Hit you with the gauge, back in place
Rip another page off the book of life
But for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see
(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)
All this liquor I drink and then I smoke all this weed
(Smoking this weed, smoking is good, but I got what you need)
A lot of niggas are changed and they be doing what I've been

But I'll always be the same, I'll always gonna keep it G
(I'm going forever be me, therefore, I'm forever a G)

It's getting hard to survive, the streets will eat you alive
Dumping your body, your cadaver is covered with flies
Too much ratchets and trapping inside your rapping
Real niggas actually laughing at your lights, camera, action
Do you, do you
And whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
Because when I bring it through, we whole court
Putting up playoff stats
While you're hanging with the roaches and rats
We're way above that
Now how you're loving that?
Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
You can't breathe, I'm digging your ditch
Can't believe I'm that deep in your shit
But for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate

The greatest trick the devil ever put together
Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
A seed of doubt could grow, quickly spread like an infection
Initiative to live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through
Should've been a screen play when I get through
Blow niggas away, IED, point blank range in the middle of the street
Fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?
We don't play no games, just play for keeps and now
Back to the forefront, back to the back who was back on the tour bus
Get around the world for a few months
Dump dead-weight niggas like a dump truck
But for tonight we gon' celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

Take a look at my eyes and tell me what do you see

Rolling stone bringing it home, time for transition

Look into my eyes, all you see is will to survive
By any means, retreating to the Philippines
To meditate, liftin train like a heavyweight
Hit you and run with a California license plate

Bitches stop actin' like niggas we can all clock figures
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my dick

Heart of Man,Man vs Machine,2002.0,"Ain't a damn thing promised to ya
Except livin your life, and dyin one day, I'm just bein honest to ya
It take a whole lot, just to get a little
Gettin caught up in the middle the answer to life's riddles
Never, come that easy, but it was easy
To lead me, but it wasn't easy to see me
Get up off the block to the TV
And sell a couple million CD's, best believe me
You see these callouses on my soul?
Couldn't let hate and paralysis, take control
I pick you up when you down 'til I can't no mo'
My name sting in your mouth like canker sores
Been at war my whole life, sleepless nights
Endless fights, but still can't walk to the light
Cause my work ain't finished on earth, for what it's worth
From the cradle to the hearse, God and family first, for real

Somewhere in the heart of man (somewhere, within, somewhere)
There comes a time when he must understand (when he must understand)
The strong withstand, the weak will fall {*repeat*}
Cause tomorrow may not come at all {*repeat*}

Life ain't long, it's more like a snapshot
You can have the top, I live for the hop
Never take a day I'm breathin on this planet for granted
Time for change, time for growth, peace understandin
See but niggas keep forcin my hand, disturbin my plans
Bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man
It's like tryin to build a house on sand; you never get
A solid foundation, one man can change the nation
Yo I put that on all creation; Haitian, Jamaican
African, Asian, Caucausian, Indian
Whatever your persuasion, this is the message
Time is of essence especially when you're countin your blessings
Lessons learned from the deepest of pain, it's not a game
Keep my name outta your mouth and I'mma keep it the same, ya dig?
It's a shame, graduated to the rap game
Only to find out crack and rap was the same thang, damn!!


Who got skill? Who got hustle?
Who got they family with 'em? Who pay for they muscle?
Yo it's all gon' come out in the wash, the lost angel
With dirty wings, bullets ricochet off my halo
I lay low for no one, I love my life
Ain't afraid of no hard work and sacrifice
Was born twice through the life of my seed
Makin sure he see a side of life, I was never able to see
Hittin home like ""Ground Zero,"" move over now
Peace to the real heroes, still underground
I put it down for the homies that came that's hard in the paint
I'm livin proof it's never to late, you straight
Once in a while I go back to the main strip
And see the same niggas still doin the same shit
And all I can do is increase the flow
Put it out, let it soak in, and hope they grow, c'mon

Enemies & Friends,At the Speed of Life,1996.0,"1996, dysfunctional member
Of the Alkaholik family, yo

Rule Number One
Always be aware of your surroundings
And peep all exits
Stay and move to the next shit
Rule Number Two
Love no one that don't love you
And if the shit come down
Then you know your way around
Rule Number Three
Realize it ain't about size
Or havin' gats and guns
Because it only takes one
Handle your business
Don't let your business handle you
It's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do
What you're doin' right here, right now
Same color, same style
Tryin' to claim worldwide
And ain't traveled but one mile
In these shoes, I paid dues
With nothin' to lose
Live by the rhyme
But I'ma die by the booze
Xzibit breakin' down niggas
Who got somethin' to prove
Here we are face to face
Nigga make your move
You're in the wrong place
But at the right situation
Cause I was waitin
Hotter than Satan, never perpetratin

I treat my enemies like friends
So I can reach out and touch
Leave'em in the dust at the very end
You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin
Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins
Animosity you can reach out and touch
Heavy right handed
Teeth grind like a clutch
And plus you ain't never had this much
Too many friends too close
You might collapse from an overdose

I was raised to never follow after no man
To be my own man
So I can die by my own hand
And never knowin' what the next day can bring
So I gotta make the ends
Justify the means
Yo, I'm on the scene, here to do my own thing
Can't never spend a lifetime
Chasin' after dreams
I got the right shit
For all the wrong reasons
As long as I breathin'
Niggas change like seasons
Never trust a man
Who can't look you in your eyes
Only the strong survive
And that's word to the wise
Yo, when dead bodies get outlined in chalk
Everybody should walk
Cause real killers don't talk
I ain't really concerned
How many bridges you burned
I extinguish your flame
And take aim at your brain
Givin' ligament pain
To have you walkin' with a cane
Wantin' money and fame
You got your fuckin' self to blame
And that's West Coast rhyme
Without no gimmicks
Here come Xzibit to break it down
Like a chemic
I'm spreadin' like an epidemic
And all good things come to an end
Enemies & Friends

I treat my enemies like friends
So I can reach out and touch
Leave'em in the dust at the very end
You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin
Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins
Animosity you can reach out and touch
Heavy right handed
Teeth grind like a clutch
And plus you ain't never had this much
Too many friends too close
You might collapse from an overdose

I don't give a fuck
About the set you claim
Xzibit easily dispersed like crack cocaine
See I lent my shotgun to Kurt Cobain
And the motherfucker never brought it back
Ahh, that's wack
As a matter of fact
This one nigga tried to jack
My squad had his ass
On the run like track
Never knowin' who to trust
In this shit called rap
Here to let you know
My sound surrounds like dat
Never half step
Or play the role like DeNiro
Y'all niggas wasn't down
When we had less than zero
Fuck tryin' to be a hero
Tryin' to save some bitch
Mr. X to the Z
Never play that shit

I treat my enemies like friends
So I can reach out and touch
Leave'em in the dust at the very end
You now tuned in to Hennessy and Gin
Ice cold Heinekens and down for whatever skins
Animosity you can reach out and touch
Heavy right handed
Teeth grind like a clutch
And plus you ain't never had this much
Too many friends too close
You might collapse from an overdose

Yes, 1996, yes
Bringin' it live from the Westside
This is X to the Z
These niggas don't know
These niggas ain't ready

Head between ya knees, prepare for crash landing
Hand in mouf is not my style

Hoes can't walk right, pigs never fly straight

First taste of the future, we all hands on

Dont shoot it, mind polluted, deeply rooted

If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick
How she acting off of the fifth? Ridiculous shit
We don't need conversation, just crowd participation
If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations
Separate myself from y'all, segregation
Trying to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation
Pure elevation, got me some inspiration
Two bitches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation
Got a live occupation, live for the moment
I'm faced with an altercation manhandling my opponents
I got eyes in the back of my head
I never sleep so they bloodshot red
Yo we so far ahead of our time
If we can stop life and press rewind

Make sure it says ANDRE YOUNG in bold letters on big checks
Your shit ain't selling? Fuck it, get Dr. Dre on it
You got a budget? I'll get down, give me half of it
One session, one song, I'm gone
The first week, you hit the streets, a star is born
To add to my universe - let me show you
Who can invade who nigga, and who can do who the worst
Warning from the Surgeon General
Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical
Pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?
Twenty years in the game, with a constant buzz
Pick a year, any year, see how hot I was
Same shit today, and still don't give a fuck!

You can't face, what we bringing
(What we bring to the game, playa)
Bounce like this (Bounce) Bounce like this
Blaze your shit, Blaze your shit
And get high for meeeeeeee

Let me give y'all niggas something to hold
This product not to be sold
Know you can't cook it over a stove
You can flip it and come back with a mitt
Don't make me reach through your limo tint
I just want my twenty percent
This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon
I think I'll stop shooting you niggas and shoot for the moon
Motherfuckers turn respect on and off like a light switch
I'll never be seen, like Farrakhan fucking a white bitch
Jump I won't flinch, dump I don't miss
X holding this, I'm never losing faith or focus
So say what you gotta say, every day a holiday
We don't blow the roof, we blow the whole fucking spot away
Organize permission like, organized crime
Organized minds, organize they nickels and dimes
Organized vocab be organizing my rhymes
Organizing my business and organizing my time, so turn it up

That ain't for real

Your flow remind me of a nigga that I just don't feel
Same style and delivery
Might as well have his grill
Pass the scapel, the alcohol, clamps
25 hundred get you style enhanced
It's like...

This, mask right here will lift your grill
It'll put height in your mack
Don't take to much off
If you want a nose like Michael Jackson

If you want it done right, nigga come see this
Maybe even send your bitch
We can fix them tits
From a C-cup to a double D-cup
Make them big shits, doctor lick 'em, yeah

I like to, axe em, jack em for their financial
Need a facial, I'll change the skin tone to interracial
After I'm done, you might have a little pouch though
Nothin' my scaple can't fix
What kind of face you want

It'll cost you

Before I sit you on my gurney
And lead you to an anesthetic breather
If you're not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right
Casue being fake ain't tight
You need plastic surgery

I hear the same ole rhymes, the same ole style
(It seems you need plastic surgery) x5

I'm located, at, the bottom of the black list
I like to malpractice, complicate a surgery
Intoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ashes in your open gases
Feel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil
And what?
When a nigga play pussy, get fucked
Without a kiss or a hug, I'm like contaminated blood
Transfused from a junkie
With the heroin jones, I reconstruct the bones
Of all hip hop clones

I date fat girls that weigh 215
With low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy
I'm performing vinyl liposuctions
(Fat MC?)
Phat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction
Needles injected 33 RPM of anesthetic for actors who require cosmetic
Sex changes from bitch niggas to rah-rah niggas
The only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick

This shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic
After Captain Save-A-Ho, we had the sex lieutenant
Operate get straight, we here to separate the fake from the classic
Niggas get blasted if they plastic


I'm like Dougie Howser M.D with a desert eagle
Criminal Genius
Operation, separatin' them siamese twins hangin' beneath them niggas' penis
Take it to your face like a skin graft
Rappers, I specialize in talent transplants
You want fat lips nurse get the collagen
And ten tons of stomach pumps from all the cum you and Richard Gere be
Swallowin'
Now followin' ask 
Vanna to buy you vowels
So you can see I, aye, E-Swift, oh, you know why
We remain uncontested to the contender, we can
Million Man March all the way to December
January, Feburary 28th

I never wash my hands
The only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick
But I'll split you quick
Got hands like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wrists and
I make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip
Hopefully, in surgery, I won't slip
On a tile that file and twist ya lips
Like Gomer Pyle
Prescriptions I'm over-ripe
For the ones thats overbitin' on dental records
Bitin', to God, send your blessings
I'll put your mask on, fast like Ramadan
Mix them bitches like half 
Lola Falana
, half blonde in the paper, they named me
A Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients
(BITCH! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE)
You don't have an appointment or an application
For me to attack your face in my practice
Never lackin' when I'm inserting these plastic patches
Seems like you need plastic surgery",https://genius.com/Xzibit-plastic-surgery-lyrics
Meaning Of Life,Napalm,2012.0,"My name is staff sergeant Shilo Harris, retired United States army
Unfortunately, while serving our nation
I was hit with a roadside bomb that was estimated at about 800 pounds of explosives
I lost 3 soldiers, my truck was destroyed
My driver and I were the only 2 soldiers out of that vehicle that survived

So what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny, cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

Let me tell you about these bitch ass, half cocked, pussy ass niggas
That's never gon' pull the trigger to protect no figures
Never seen a hard time in your life
Beating the shit out of your kids and your wife
Cause what you lack in a fight
That we all fightin' a similar, self-hated mutilation
The lost angel, Los Angeles, congratulations
From admiration, to aggravation, to the highest level
Don't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle
Heart colder than gun metal, I done survived it all
Praying for my downfall, got the fuck from around y'all
No more niggas bringing me down, even including myself
I celebrate life for nobody else
Mountains of wealth ain't really shit without health
My mental shrouded in stealth
Cause hell is crowded with cowards who fell for the dollar
Now watch Xzibit rise to power
I turn these 15 minutes to hours
But still asking

What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

Let me tell you bout' these hypocrites and halfwits
Caught up in the politics
Work yourself to death, but uncle Sam is taking all of it
Prisoner to the policy, the mark of the beast
Becoming one with technology, surveillance a beach (bitch)
And everyone one of us, some of us got no heart or no backbone
The few will seek freedom while most of the masses will conform
The woman you lust for, is usually not the one
To stick around when you go to war
Immaculate platform
We back and prepared for, attacking the landlords
Cause this shit too hot, we 'bout to get what we came for
And if I should die, may it not be in vain more
Importantly, more to see, keep it cracking and orderly
Got my future in front of me, focus is fucking phenomenal
Nobody can touch us, I turn the impossible possible with it
Do me a favor man, do not try to tell me shit
It's just me and my bitch

What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya
All I know if you spend too much time without being refined
Then your life will be described as a failure

When I was injured, I sustained 35% burns over my body
I lost my ears, my nose, and have been through many reconstructive surgeries
My father was there, my wife was there, my children
That was a lot of my motivation, was because
I knew the way that they were looking at me
I had to get stronger, I had to become independent again
And I think that's why I pushed so hard

Let me tell you 'bout these long days and sleepless nights
Penny pinchin' trying to make it to the afterlife
And not to mention time is short, you better make it right
Before you see that final light get all your business tight
This is the gospel, gotta get it or get left alone
So get it on until your destiny is set in stone
The dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death
So make it count and live your life out loud with no regrets
This for the set, this for the ones that's never wakin' up
Livin' a fantasy, insanity, they fake as fuck
They out of touch, they out of line, it's time to face the truth
That I wasn't supposed to make it, now I'm living proof
Excavated mountains of misery, eventually found the fountain of youth
It'd been pissed in, shit in, violated, so they pollute
That's why they shoot, have your ass in a box dressed in a suit
'Bout time you got in touch with your roots

So what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?
Man I don't know, I don't know
Cuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage
Grand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show
What's the meaning of life?

The best help that you can do, is help yourself
You have to, to step up, you have to find the strength inside of you
To pull yourself through it, because, you know, you can
You can have people pull you everyday
But unless you're willing to move, and you're willing to move forward
Then you're gonna be stuck in a rut
And you're gonna be stuck in that bad place that is depressing
And holding you back
The only person that can set you free is yourself",https://genius.com/Xzibit-meaning-of-life-lyrics

Ever wonder why only certain motherfuckers get rich?
Ain't this a bitch, barely can eat, barely can pee
I dedicate my life to the street
It's not for you if your stomach is weak
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets
That's the only time I really find peace
Havin violent stand-offs with the police
North Hollywood beef, grindin my teeth
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief
New breed I'm the bad seed
Smokin weed 'til my motherfuckin eyes bleed

Me and my staff run a worldwide warpath
A bloodbath make Xzibit have a good laugh
It's goin down, hit the ground like a plane crash

Been a Long Time,Restless,2000.0,"Rrrah, uhh, bitch!
It's radio radio station, cat Xzibit huh?
K-W-Balls, Daniel Thompson hold like this
Like that in fact, with a fat-ass Battlecat track
I'm takin caller number one, that is..
Rrrah uhh, bitch - you took too long
Caller number two like this..

Bounce up out of the house close to midnight
Full rack up in the back, shit is tight
Full charge and I'm out for somethin'
Mass production, Battlecat bang percussion
End of discussion, hittin' some corners, rearrange things
And bring change, we expand California
Listen, I lost more than I can ever gain back
From this road to riches, makin' my heart turn black
So I'm cold to bitches, and I never call back
Plus I'm stoned and vicious, lay your whole hood flat
Get your, shit together nigga big Snoop Dogg told me
Do music and leave that other shit alone homie
We came from dust, the X-odus, the hard to touch
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with us, and plus
It ain't nothin' like standin' on your own two
So run them streets, but never let 'em run you

Time is steady wastin', steady wastin'
Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait
Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin'
I'll bust 'til I'm deceased
 yeah, wooh-ooh

Tune in, witness the rise of a icon
The python wrap around 'til your breath gone
The upper echelon, and I'm the cat you pull a weapon on
And wanna squeeze 'til my life is gone
Back to the wall and trust nobody
Sippin' Cognac with Kurupt, Young Gotti
Somebody gotta recognize this
Throw fo' fingers up, add a thumb, then make it a fist
Number one draft pick, lead the league in assists
Give a fuck how you decorate your neck and your wrists
You just settin' yourself up for the twist (gimme that) it's like this
Only a few slide through like the Schindler's List
Who's the bitch, who's the mack, what's worse
The niggas that bring in the coke or smoke the crack?
Metaphor figure four let it break your back (yeah)
It's been a long time, where the gangstas at?

Time is steady wastin', steady wastin'
Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait
Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin'
I'll bust 'til I'm deceased
 yeah, wooh-ooh

Damn it feels good to be back in the saddle
On top of the game, crackin' the frame, the heat of the battle
Been a long time comin' but we waited
Xzibit went from bein' hated, to makin' the whole world say it
Give a fuck if the radio play it
Niggas fall like the domino effect and you can't delay it
It ain't about who you are when you're makin' your stack
It's the look that's on your face when you givin' it back
Picture that
[Outro: Nate Dogg & 
Xzibit

Time, keeps on slippin', slippin'
Keeps on slippin' away, mm-hmm
My mind keeps on trippin'-trippin'
Trippin' like every-day, mm-hmm (word, yeah)
Yeah, it's been a long time
Time is steady wastin', steady wastin'
Since time won't wait for me, yeah, won't wait, won't wait
Just give me a beat that's bang, give me a beat that's bangin'
I'll bust 'til I'm deceased

Eyes May Shine,At the Speed of Life,1996.0,"Yeah yeah
Look, you could've got away but your response wasn't quick enough
Can't preserve life cause the vest wasn’t thick enough
Teflon, Napalm, Homicide scenes
These are a few of my favorite things!
But I ain't Mary so ain't a damn thing poppin
Only death disease and a whole lota palm trees
Not only for mics, Xzibit is a way of life
Until my death so I celebrate success
Best of the best wouldn't test these waters with a yacht
Sendin' sixteen shots across your parking lot
All up in your proximity drinking Hennessy
Holdin down ground like the Statute of Liberty
So nobody ever can rush my spot
And the torch stay lit so I ain't worried about shit
It ain't where you're from it's all about how you represent!
Unfamiliar faces better know who your fuckin' with

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit
And all of that shit
And you still won't step
So what's next?
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit
And all of that shit
And you still won't step
So what's next?
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin


I'm only comin' through when it's time for collection
Xzibit forever nasty, spread like infection
Ain't no protection ever made by man to withstand this punishment
In other words runnin' shit
Keep your eyes wide cause the style gets darker
I make papers and see more new cars than Bob Barker
Cause if the price ain't right then it's time to take flight
Let the piece go twice to make sure you see the light
Plus I'm dreaded not by the locks but by the cops
And flocks of females that only think with their crotch
Unlimited smoke
The bonified cut throat Columbian necktie
Now don't you look fly
I'll leave you there to be discovered by your mother
Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover
No matter your background Xzibit never backs down
Be prepared for static and semi-automatics in your grill

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit
And all of that shit
And you still won't step
So what's next?
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit
And all of that shit
And you still won't step
So what's next?
All of a sudden you ain't sayin nothin


Everything that come around go 3.6.0
Longitude and latitude
It's all in the attitude
I'm in the mood to put a twist on things
Xzibit here to rock the planet 'till the fat bitch sings
The shit is closer than you think
Don't blink it might be over in a matter of seconds
I'd like to say this off the record
But it's not
So I testify to the fact
Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact
It makes it real easy to trip
Unload the whole clip on your block then split!
Ain't no answers to the test you taking
Never move fakin'
Can't be shaken'
From my solid foundation like this

Eyes may shine, Teeth may grit
And all of that shit
And you still won't step
So what's next?

Carry the Weight,At the Speed of Life,1996.0,"Intro: Xzibit, 

I really wish I could act the way you want, you know what I'm saying?
[I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things
I do, you know what I'm sayin']
Gotta carry the weight you know what I'm sayin'
Go ahead, check that shit out
Verse One:
You see I don't like to reminisce about the past
Lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth
Each and every wrong move the police keep count
Make it real fuckin' easy to get stretched out
I was at the funeral when it all began
You know the painful transition from a boy to man
Lost sight of my mother at the age of nine
Didn't understand death, nearly lost my mind
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it
Age ten, new step family arrangement
At thirteen, started gettin' hair on my dick
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit
I would forever be hit with anything in reach
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach
About forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked
Didn't jump when he said then that ass got cracked
Physical contact was in form of a slap
At the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back
Courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes all black
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate
I don't remember the date of the judicial debate
But legally I was now in custody of the state
Chorus:
And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate
And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
I gotta find some way, Xzibit carry the weight
Interlude: Xzibit, 


Yo

Insane man, I don't know man, he he he

Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man
YouknowI'msayin'

It's cool yo fuck that

They can go on and on for that

Alright, in a minute

And now was was worse than the treatment I was gettin' at home
Only now I was fucked up plus all alone
My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone
Turned age sixteen now on my own
Started running with cats who carried gats cause they had too
No hesitation, lock load then blast you without a hassle
We in a town of hicks, fuckin' all these chicks
Sellin' rock by the bricks
So we sellin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown
At the house when the motherfucking man touched down
Screaming demands: ""Let me see your goddamn hands! (Now!)""
ATF cause a handguns's a contraband
Never kept it in the house so of course we clowned
Only found one pistol took us all down town
We be out by the end of the afternoon
Getting drunk on the strip let the system boom
Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife
Ty and Matt caught bodies
Now they spend there life behind bars
Catching scars that will not heal
Niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate
And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
I gotta find some way, Xzibit carry the weight
And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate

Wasn't much for a nigga to do but start thinkin
Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend

Shouldn't have asked that, called the bitch collect (It's Xzibit)

And if you ain't rollin with that then watch your back
Level four right away, gettin hit the same day
Paying the price for the games you play
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away
Can't remember what a t-bone taste like
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life
Motherfuckers cryin, shanks gettin sharpened
Tags gettin tagged up, plottin and talkin
Sellin everything from weed to blow
When it's time for you to go you're the last to know
Niggas holdin weight, SA's got the power
Locked down, one shower every seventy-two hours
Top Ramen and tuna, trigger happy sharpshooters
Waitin for the jump off, can't wait to thump off
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch
I seen niggas sleep for weeks, get too weak
And then physically and mentally cannot compete
Find new shit to master, make the time move faster
Home sweet home, shipped off to Land Caster
Kept a low pro, close to home and I'm trippin
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin
Everybody runnin they mouth, pussy to count
Cause bitches in Cali love niggas thats freshed out
But some of these niggas on swipe
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked
Fuck that, when I touch back I got plans
If I can't rock the powder, rock the fans
Give my naked pictures away, shake some hands
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again
On all times take the long walk to the front gate
Dress out spreading shit, today my release date

 Alright my niggas, I'm gone, see you in an ounce dog, woo!
 What's up nigga
 Yeah, what's up nigga
 Hey get in the car, my nigga, sup X?
Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga
Lucky I didn't pawn that motherfucker
 Ha, yeah right
Check it out dog, everybody know that you just got out
That shit was all on the radio
But dig it I got two strippin bitches
Just flew in from motherfuckin Las Vegas
Ready to get down and dirty, I got a pound of weed, got on the Hennessy
Everybody at the club waitin, what you wanna do?
 Take me to the motherfuckin studio",https://genius.com/Xzibit-release-date-lyrics
Highest Form of Understanding (H.F.O.U.),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, the first night I spent in California
I was homeless on Venice Beach, yeah

It was all a dream
Came to California at seventeen
Little nigga tryna bubble up from the crack scene
It got so complicated, then I graduated
Haters so mad I made it
How could I fly so high, only to feel so low?
How do they live so fast only to grow so slow?
Like when you showing no support for your kids
But got money for marijuana just to smoke with your friends
Or that woman who survives and beats cancer
Only to be drowned in debt with no answers
The frequency of tragedy, it happens so rapidly
That we became numb, we embraced this insanity
Some wack-job haul off and smoke his whole family
Reality T.V. that's not based in reality
Stuck watching train wrecks, everybody going for self
Self worth is important but for money and wealth
This mentality of ""me, fuck everything else""
It's a virus, a disease, I'm a victim myself
But I swear before I leave, I'mma fix it, I swear
I'mma fix it, I swear, yo, you better beware

Rich boy kill his own wife, knocks her teeth out
Cuts her fingers off, then escapes with a suicide
The king of pop died,
 
Michael Vick was fighting dogs
But he walked and did his time, let him throw the fucking ball
As the markets keep crashing and people get desperate
Putting faith in the false feeling so disrespected
Turn to this record, the highest form of understanding
Understand me, fight or flight for your family
Come, walk with a soldier
Come, talk with a soldier, yeah
Cinderblock stop shooting straight from the shoulder
As we all get older and hope falls over
And damn, you were six years sober
And just like that, now you back where you started, square one
And you can't bring it back once that bullet leave the gun
As the planner gets smaller, prepare for the North American Union
A (?) to replace your dollars
Narcissistic society, love paparazzi
Get to Starbucks for your overpriced latte
Ignoring all the signs, ""nevermind"" is your mindstate
Until the end of time, shit is closer than you think man

I done been in situations where the only thing that I could do was read the Bible
Went in to the hill, child, with a sharpened piece of metal, the only way of survival
Made up my mind that I don't ever wanna return, chance was given again
Now I'm back out in the world, made a promise to God for living in sin
I can never lie to God but it's so hard to live right
I'm carrying seven-point-six-twos to fistfights
Ain't nobody playing fair, they cheat, no cheat
I ain't fitting to be the topic of the preacher's eulogy speech
The word say, ""turn the other cheek"" that's what they teach us
But Peter sliced the ear of a nigga rolling on Jesus
I don't want applause I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm a real nigga, one from a million, chosen few
Everlasting pain has got my brain, it's like it's trapped inside a maze
Have you been unfaithful to the game?
Damn shame
Eighteen years, you never believed him
That's your son, go and see him, motherfucker
You fucked his mother
The goddamn common courtesy never applied to you
'Cause you thought she lied to you
You couldn't see your own mother in his face
If you die, he'll be in a better place, bring the tape back",https://genius.com/Xzibit-highest-form-of-understanding-hfou-lyrics

Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

... we just boogy, advance
The rubber band stack thick in my pants
Real gangsters make plots and plans and touch dirt
Only prayin for the day when they can wash they hands
Real gangsters leave nothin to chance at first glance
If it ain't a sho' thing then you bet' not swing
Real gangsters keep that Cutlass clean, keep the monsters mean
And when you dump it drop it right at the scene
Real gangsters got a gangsta lean
You might not talk red, black, or blue but everybody talk green
Glance to my left look over my right shoulder
Livin life in my rearview, FUCK stayin sober
Forget back I sit back and wait for the click-clack
Real gangsters want real spit so I spit that
Real gangsters don't even say it
They just hit the trunk cock it and spray it
Light up your Christmas! Yeah!

We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by
It's either ride or die...

... and don't slip up
It's way too late when the bodybags zip up
Real gangsters pray for they soul when they get up
You live by the gun but you'll die by that hit up
Watch that rig up, find yo'self in a box
In a spot where the cops can't dig up
Real gangsters ain't just thugs in bandanas
Slugs and big cannons, drugs and big hammers
Real gangsters open up ya minds and expand 'em
Why was 2Pac really spittin at the cameras?
Cause real gangsters get no peace, they want us six feet deep
Or locked down in the belly of the beast
Real gangsters make bread, rise like yeast
Won't hesitate to put hot chrome to ya teeth
So fuck beef! Real gangsters load heat
When ya see 'em in the street better call the police, c'mon

We just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky
Keep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by
Cause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly
My gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by

... syndrome is a fear
That inner-city residents have of they own peers
People in they own community
Usin a case where two blacks got smoked by one in '93
And ain't now nigga be the murder case
Usin and servin survival shit as a defense plea
In Cali big knot (knot)
The judicial system out here'll have you level fo' 'til you rot
It's because of the system we violence stricken
Forced to frequent the zone when the reefer's driftin
And it's hella drift cause in Southeast Danglewood
Damn near, 30 years of Bloodin and Crippin
And we inflicted with a disease mo' trip than an H-I-V
Can't nuthin protect you from a hundred, drummer 2-2-3's
You can call the police
Wear a V-E-S-T but forget about safety

All foreign passports to the left
All resident passports to the right, you dig?

Welcome to my world of hurt
Where I put in work
I got guns that knock you off of this Earth
Stand up, let yourself be heard

Once things begin, my nigga, it won't stop
Lock down your blocks, let's flood the streets
Now welcome to the world of Mr. X-to-the-Z

Motherfucker, I'm back with a vengeance
Back with the business, I'm a vet with a pension
A man with a vision, I'm a man on a mission
So crowd around, listen
This that hardcore heavy head bang, you've been missing
Go to DEFCON 1 if you don't comply
I might explode like a meth lab, there is no rehab
Bitches need knee pads, a pound and some Zig Zags
That last like Etta James, I'm back, let the cage rap
Charles Bronson, visionary marksman
Heartless, leave your intellect on your carpet
I don't really start shit, I just like to finish it
Dismember with a hacksaw, get rid of it
I'm so militant, you so Gilligan, killing it
Heard you want the coast on your back

Chromed out classics, block after block
When I park, so Jurassic
Cameras start flashing, everybody asking
Harassing, suck my dick with six aspirins
That'll keep your head tight, back from the afterlife
Locked in my hurt locker, built up my appetite
You need your name in lights, when I just need a mic
And I can level any playing field like a sheet of ice
It's going down like when you cuffed and they read your rights
I'm going higher, better bail if you're afraid of heights
I'm ritual killing, prepare for a sacrifice
Roll her like a pair of dice, lounging in paradise
Jealous niggas want to feed, like a parasite
Burn leeches off with cigarettes, I just need a light
I been around, seen the press get it shut down
I'm stadium status, the crowd gotta move now

Welcome to my world of hurt

A man dies once, a coward dies a thousand times
Your bitch ass is on nine hundred and ninety-nine
You only got one more, you better make it last
Before I lay this hurt locker to your fucking ass
Lock chop choppers, chop shop droppers
Fresh state to state until the feds came knocking
Call us in the clutch when your shows ain't popping
When your hoes ain't dropping, when your flows ain't rocking

Welcome to my world of hurt

But always wanna fuckin argue so let's figure this out
I'm just tryna make you happy bitch
Who's there for you anytime you get in the mood for suckin a dick

You could say I didn't do this shit
Unsatisfied bitches gotta go out and chase the dick

Make ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight
I'll go from all night 'til the sun turn bright
Two wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat

You only tell me that you love me when you're flat on your back
You wanna leave me now bitch, my fuckin feelings is hurt
Why am I the only one that's tryna make this work

Ha, yeah, break it loud

Yeah, when it's all said in done, we gon' be on top
'Cause we don't stop, now, lock it down, hit the spot
And clown niggas relyin' on special effects
While the khakis and chronic, got the bitches still breakin' they neck
Move the crowd without breakin' a sweat
Trendsetter, with a Beretta, so keep it on deck
'Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna roll through the set
Don't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept
At a nightclub, talkin' 'bout you don't go out
And you tryin' to got to school to make a certain amount
But the last part, I just couldn't figure it out
I guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth
Lightweight, like confetti
Steadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready
To deal with the legendary
Soopafly
, X-Z, and 
Bullet Loco
Shot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po

Round and round we go, it don't stop
'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot
Baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin' good with your stink-ass
Type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast
Make it hot, baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!

This bitch ain't got the pot to piss in
Keepin' it next to the name and her gun
This the Dulo gang bitch
Who the fuck want some?
You got titties and ass
But I got a dick and some cash
If you ain't talkin' about shit
Then I'ma smash, bitch
On three, on me, bitch, you my property
Daddy Jayo Felony, and ain't nobody stoppin' me
And I said daddy, bitch, yeah, that's what you gon' call me
I ain't no simp or no wimp
I'ma motherfuckin pimp
Terrorizin' my hoes, make they high-heels fall off
You got me close to fucked up, if you think I'm goin' soft
On ya; I'm hard on my hoes, that's how it goes
Bitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four
You got my name, you bounced
So you might as well break bread
And only Dulo niggas know, what's the head
My name is Billy Loco, and this is my opinion
I'm coming from SD, and Dulo is my religion
Bi-b-b-b-biatch!

Round and round we go, it don't stop
'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot
Baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin' good with your stink-ass
The type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast
Make it hot, baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!

I don't save 'em, pay 'em, or buy clothes
All I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!
In Jamaica, at the Half Moon Villa
With a killa and a cocaine dealer, layin' low from the law
See, it all comes down to who's quick to draw first
Pay attention, prevention, ridin' off in a hearse
Mister X to the you know me
Thousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free
The dysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family tree
Frequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee
Hennessey on the rocks, with Pina Colada
At the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna
For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees
After that, we kickin' back and burn up some trees
Mad shout, 'cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin'
'Cause, I'm an 
Alkaholik.
 and I'm late for my meeting
(Come on, Like that!)

Round and round we go, it don't stop
'Til we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot
Baby girl do the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin' good with your stink-ass

D.I.T.C. and X to the Z
Get it crackin' to the third degree
Xzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V
We bring rap to your city like B.E.T
But still feel California is the place to be, catastrophe

The Alkaholiks is back to fry you extra crispy
With the skills that make the plots to try and diss me extra risky
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate and stop my forward motion
California will have broken off and fell into the ocean
Cause I rocked around the world with my ill type skill
Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks is getting blended
Certified bartender, go catch the 40 when I send it your way

Niggas that hustle till the day light break
Go to county 20 times, till can't go straight
Don't nothing in the motherfucking world come free
I'll never see a nine to five cause it just ain't me

What do you expect from a nigga with my intellect?
East coast representing West coast gangsta
Nah, I ain't tripping, I call up King Tee, we go dipping
Through the streets pumping hardcore Likwit beats
Flowing air, blowing, lounging in them leather seats
Thinking back how we used to rock the house party
Now we just fucking it up for everybody

How dare you try to compare yourself to the original
Professional Xzibit break you down like correctional facility's
Limit all capabilities, motherfuck MC's
Hard to read like Japanese
I'm spreading like disease so I can't be stopped
By who you run with, your clique or the bitch ass cops
Xzibit’s first LP, it hit your block like crack rock
I’m blowing up your spot by remote, it's the cutthroat

I""m from 
Cristal-ifornia
, I warned ya I'd be on ya
I'm off the paint like velvet paintings, make your mama mourn ya
The Ro is outer national, cold as Henne-sota
I smoke 12 MC's a day just to fill my quota
From Fourty Ohio all the way to Ore-gin

Kenny Parker Show 2001,Restless,2000.0,"You are now tuned in to the ultimate sounds.. of Dr. Dre
You know what time it is!
Xzibit steps up to the mic
Layin down the hard-core, real raw, underground
My name is KRS-One, and it's REAL!!

Well it's me, down with D-R-E
X to the Z rocks any party
Rocks the beats, and the breaks
Rocks the cocks off the whores in the place
Cause suckers shake, while I'm creatin
They get together and they start to hatin
How can we take him out one time
Cause he brought back the West with the freshest rhymes
I might go first, and he'll go second
I'll wreck 'em, deck 'em, set it, just checkin your mic
Droppin hot shit I like
So throw up your hands bitch, run your ice
Cause I'll go third, and he'll go fourth
By the fifth eat shit, you'll step off
Six is your beatdown, your title is seven
Takin out your four man crew makes eleven
By the twelveth I go for self
Rockin L.A. like no one else..
You can check any rapper from the underground scene
But few have dropped hot shit and seen green
Some have dope twelve inches, count 'em
But not many niggas have slammin albums
X to the Z rocks consistantly
I'm ""Criminal Minded"" so don't fuck with me
Why? Well that's my secret baby
I don't take shit, so fuck you, pay me
So you can call me, a public servant
Not a king but a teacher I believe I've earned it
So I just walk, or ride my bike
And bust on the +Up In Smoke+ stage tonight
Give me a chance and I'll rock the house
But let a motherfucker try to take me out
Cause male or female, I will strangle
If it's a label, they have to untangle
Adidas, chains, jerseys, braids
Bandanas hangin off the end of my gauge
Step right up if that's what you like
But watch your bitch, I catch hoes like a dyke
In the night at a height right for flight
Way out of sight, you bite, I recite
My chain shine bright, plus my kicks stay white
As your faggot CEO say, ""Well alright!""
.. I am your mentor
History is mine, it's time you surrender motherfuckers
And just back up quickly
Your style is sickly but you persist to get me
Or outwit me with the style that I created
Years ago when I was sellin powder to the hoes
Oh, all of a sudden you don't know
Or can't remember can't recall can't bring to mind
That rhyme that place do not chase
I run a marathon a race of rhymes in your FACE
In case you hate I won't write no tough rap
Fuck with me get your whole FAMILY kidnapped

Yo Xzibit! Show these motherfuckers man!
I don't think they understand this shit!
Break this shit over they backs!

I don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo
I only grab a nine to bust holes in your crew
I deny your existence as artists
You puttin out a record expectin to chart but it's weak
But when you speak through the microphone
You fail to realize, nope, you're not alone on the earth
The light comes forth cause Mr. X
Intelligence, smoke and guns manifest in the flesh
I snatch the mic and get hype
Behave, before you make the news front page
Headed for the grave and the wake
So save your microscopic miniature small talk and WALK
And put a little pep in your step
X to the Z will destroy any motherfuckin rep-utation
In the nation, in creation
All you assholes in ANY occupation
Like rappers with nothin to say
I CRUSH 'EM like chronic and then smoke 'em with Dre
Cause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather
Gather together and splatter
Whatever egotistic bullshit, the game is over
When you push the record but don't push the culture

Breakin, emceein, graffiti art, deejayin, beatboxin
Yo Xzibit, keep rockin!

Just throw your hands in the sky
Still believe real niggas never die
And if you in this life just gettin by
Somebody say, ""I'm high!""
(I'm high!) ""I'm high!""
(I'm high!) Yeah, and you don't stop
Yeah..

Woop woop, woop, woop woop!
You know what time it is

Sniff white lines off powerful men
But see, all that's a thing of the past, she got class
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash
She ain't from money, so she start from scratch, it's hard working for scraps
It take everything she got not to relapse
Locked down a nine-to-five, but at the nine-to-five
She get sexually harassed and chastised
Boss is a married man, she won't touch him
Frustrated angry man, she won't fuck him
She's out of her job, a basket case
Least it came wit an eight, two lines to the face
Goddamn

It's a cold, cold, world
And you know it
Niggas will lay you down and take your bread, yeah
And you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up
Or you can just die with it (Die)
Only two choices, you can give it up
Or you can just die with it, yeah

He was on his own, at a very young age
When he learned from the streets, made everything change
See he came up with hustlers, lost his religion
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin
I ain't talkin paper like Jigga or Dre
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit
Now his mother work for minimum pay
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a gatling gun
In the streets, jackin niggas for fun
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him
They found out where mom stayed and went steppin
The evil that men do, but still we continue
With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar, it's so cold

It's a cold, cold, world
And you know it
Niggas will lay you down and take your bread, yeah
And you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up
Or you can just die with it (Die)
Only two choices, you can give it up
Or you can just die with it, yeah

He was 13, brought up in Baghdad
Ate with his right and made money with his left hand
Prayed to the East, 5 times daily
His mother and father just had a new born baby
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith
Never trippin off Western ways, it meant nada
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kabba
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor
He heard about the buildings on 9-11
And a man named Bush on a search for weapons
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam
With 88 thousand tons of missals and bombs
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold... damn

It's a cold, cold, world
And you know it
Niggas will lay you down and take your bread, yeah
And you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up
Or you can just die with it (Die)
Only two choices, you can give it up
Or you can just die with it, yeah",https://genius.com/Xzibit-cold-world-lyrics
Shroomz,40 Days & 40 Nightz,1998.0,"It's a long day Friday
It's like movin' all this weight
Got Xzibit up tight, right
Partner came through with two white boys (Duuude)
Talkin' noise bout a hot spot
Where bitches come alone
And niggas don't cock block
Let the top drop
And we out
Hit the liquor store
Give me O.E. and three blunts
No, make it four
Anything else? (Vitamin C pills and orange juice)
What are you drinking, gin? (Nah dude, it's the shroomz)
The shroomz? (What?)
Yeah, that's some other shit
One of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mothership
How high it make you get?
Fucked up?
Throwing up guts?
Or do it have you stuck with soft dick and can't fuck?
Hold up

Now chew 'em up and slam the orange juice
Vitamin C chase
Kill the taste
You can tell it's nasty by the look on my face
Don't get it twisted like a nigga coked up
And druggied down
See cannibus and mushrooms be coming from the ground
All natural
Post it at the club
Looking funny-style
Tight slack
Pimp feather hat
Where the bitches at?
We giving orders at the bar holding money
When all of a sudden
All the people started looking funny
And started lookin runny
And liquify
Right before my very eye
This a different kind of high
(Ohh shit, you see this shit
These motherfuckers melting and shit...)

Niggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize
Feeling hypnotized
Pupils dialated, changing size
That's when I heard the battle cries from across the room
Set these crooked niggas straight
Likwit Crew, activate
Form of, a bunch of wild niggas mashing you
Came crashing through
Elbows and right hooks for you
We got thrown out by this time
My shit is blown out
Pull the phone out
Accelleration and we bone out
In the zone out beyond
Captain Kurk and Klingon
Shit that I'm on
Be high powered like a Yukon
Back to my house, fucked up
Trying to see straight
How much of that bullshit did I actually take?
(2 grams dude)
God damn, no wonder why I feel like a underneath
Told the white boy ""Faggot, we got beef.""
Over did it holmes
Niggas playin' bones in the living room
Restless, try to find anything to mess with
Where my keys at?
Pickin up clothes, trying to fold the shit
See my riot gage on the wall, better unload the shit
Fucked up niggas and firearms dont mix right
Cocked back the chamber, dumping shells 'til it felt light
Thought I dumped the all, Counted 7
But it was 8, straight gone
Point the barrel at the floor, let it go

Fuck! Shit!...Wooow...Ay, ay, ay, It's cool, I just shot the floor man
It's all good, it's all good...Ay, ay, where everybody at? Ah shit

Uh-huh, hah.. I'mma sit back
Tell you niggas what I been lookin at, huh

Y'all niggas is killin me
You got Bloods and Crips in New York City, is anybody feelin me?
I ain't concerned with who gon' shoot who
I'm only concerned with music, and who break through
FUCK YOU, for thinkin platinum is the ultimate goal
These faggot niggas gettin they money, but losin they soul
I don't wanna hear shit from you niggas with no background
No backbones, you get no chance to back down
Deal how we deal witcha, peons, no chips
Changin whips out so they can look richer
I see the big picture, startin in the kitchen
With bricks and Pyrex pots, the widescreen edition
Listen, I seen niggas hit with so much time loc
They have to die and come back three times to see them white folks
Take notes, cause you will be tested
Vested up, drunk as fuck, large caliber weapons
I feel you.. rap niggas, fuckin it up
Monkey-mouthed muh'fuckers, spoilin the cut
For real niggas in the street, really hustlin weight
See they networks and blueprints on hip-hop tapes
Johnny Law catchin on, soakin up the game
How you think they find the stash spots and follow the slang? STUPID
Grown men playin cops and robbers
Death for dollars, I'm too laid back to holla

 What a mess..
""And Ruff up, the motherfuckin House"" - GZA
""Hope y'all niggas hearin this right""
""We.. we gon'.. we gon' gon' win""

Look at what we leavin behind
We back at square one, ridin, with nuttin to ride fo'
Dyin for nuttin worth dyin fo'
The blind lead the blind with a blindfold, with ""Eyes Wide Shut""
Save mine up, cause nothin ever last forever
Never nothin out of my reach, we blast whoever
I can split a muh'fucker from his ass to his last thought
Shit talk, then stomp through the asphault
It's yo' fault we tow-truck for your outline
In due time, you'll find, the world is mine
So I listen to the rhetorhic, jealousy and the ignorance
Can't stop me nigga, my mind too militant
God blessed me with a chin
And a heavy right-left combination that'll cave your face in
So don't make me hurt you, patience is virtue
They only got a few of us let, huh


Primo.. turn me up..
Now it's two-thousand-and-two; where kids do
Whatever the fuck they wanna do, huh, sad but true
Wanna take another life like it's the thing to do
Shit, we the biggest gang, flaggin red white and blue baby
Designer drugs, pimps and thugs
Can't shoot, innocent folks, hit with slugs
One day it's gon' all make sense, 'til then
Use your brains and your strength it's your best defense, c'mon

In the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep
Fuck piece bare back doggystyle

Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown

We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan
Break ya bitch and take ya doe
Shake ya Crys and take it whoa

To whom it may concern, yeah, listen
Sorry I'm away so much, yeah, yeah
All the sons, daughters, penitentiary niggas, yeah feel me
Uh, sorry I'm away so much, yeah

My son was born about four and a half years ago
Loved and protected him, amazin' how fast they grow
I came to know about his likes and his dislikes (yeah)
Video games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)
This is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin' all upset
When I leave the house, poutin', let me tell you about
Tryna' make it in this world and provide for you
Cause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too
Never knew that I would have to be away so much
Five thousand dollar phone bills keepin' in touch
We Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life (yeah)
I rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight
Long nights in the studio take me away
Gettin' mad cause I'm tired and you want me to play
Money can't replace time, I'm just tryna get you outta the fine relyin' and expand your mind my lil' ni', yeah
Yeah, c'mon

Look, sorry I'm away so much
Understand me, yeah
It's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)
C'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much
Huh, we keep it gangsta

Look, I got a brother locked down, he be out in a couple
Knuckle for knuckle, a veteran and nothin' but muscle
Now broadcastin' live from behind the wall
Stayin' tight through long kites and telephone calls
Gettin' hype when you see your brother on T.V
Can't wait for your release so you can roll with me
Arrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be
For right now here's a thousand, J, stay low-key
You say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute
Knee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not
Sleepin' on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops
Muthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way
You goin' from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)

Yeah, we keep it moving
Sorry I'm away so much
All the daughters, all the sons
It's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)
C'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much
Huh, we keep it gangsta

Now I ain't never been this hot before
So in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before
I'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year
Up in the studio freakin' and mixin' rhymes in here
Nothin' but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke
Women and sheer, callin' playa niggas there
Not the kinda place I really wanna bring my son
Get on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun
Used to be there cook a beat up there sewin' your clothes
While I'm with you on the Play Station showin' you codes
Hit the X button stupid, forward, left, right, X
Now I'm tryna get your college fund, bustin' with X

Come here, give that here dada
No no don't do that mama cause dada be back
Here go your ba-ba, Pampers, flashy and you can see that
You tryna figure out why dada talkin to you through this glass on the phone, oh, I socked a bitch and then she snitched
But I'll be home, can't keep me away, just can't stay away
That's my P.O baby, she don't want nothin'

Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman

Provide a place for all my peoples to eat
I'm feeling stuck, had to hustle up
The A-T-F, hit the house, had me shackled up
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out
You never let a brother down, when you stressing out
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man
I understand that you love me and you want the best
But if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest
I rock a vest, baby!

And all this time it was you
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was putting you through
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I must do
I used to think I was the MAN, wasn't having a clue
I wasn't looking for no love, but I found it in you
It's so true, behind every great man is a women
Every time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come running
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down
You always given me another reason, I can smile
Cause you believed in me, when there was nothing there to see
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree
Ugh, nothing can stop us now, Vera Wang gown
Watching your father, walk his little lady down the isle
Cause you the one for me!

I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Let my nuts hang, Cali bang at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything

My back was to the wall, risked it all, after all, all I had was me
Just tenacity, some old weed with some swisha sweets
Now everything I ride around got a captain seat
Fuck y'all dry, sawed-off and done rapidly
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions
The opportunist it's you moving in my position
But I'm a heavyweight, humble, hitting the heavy bag
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out
Picking the shit up where I left off
You went soft and sensitive, too timid to tangle with the Lost Angel
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business
Diversify you millions, you can live off the interest
Make every revenue stream flood, see where it took me
And make that money stack higher than giraffe's pussy

I was on the block pitching rocks at fifteen
I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Let my nuts hang, Cali bang at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything

I used to have a Glock that I would shoot through a backpack
So it wouldn't leave no shells at the scene
When I was getting my gift-back
Yeah, this for the homie whack, roll through and chop it up
On hard to make the west divided a united front
Burn big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California
Where people fake it 'till they make it
Or take it with a hand gun
Take your chances, swing, try to land one
Now you're in the box like a Samsung, I march through the madness
My symphony deliver something classic
Either you ironclad or you plastic, jumped in or drafted
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you rollin' with?
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony
Stage presence, reminiscent of a flashbang
Gave my girl a son and my last name

I was on the block pitching rocks at fifteen
I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Let my nuts hang, Cali bang at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything
They're talking about they locked up in a coop in the mansion
I'm saying you can't knock me off the square that I stand in
Nobody gave me nothing, this is just where I landed
'Cause now I got everything, bitch, I got everything

Motherfucker, my livin' room look like a drive in
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins
Nothing but respect when I walk through the lions den
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything
Nothing ever compares with the strength of a free mind
You find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind
Use it too fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors
When you mold them and lead them, fuck a positive message
This is a lifetime of lessons, boiled down to the essence
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence
Make every revenue stream flood, look where it took me
And make that money stack higher than giraffe pussy

I was on the block pitching rocks at fifteen
I remember underage drinking at sixteen
Let my nuts hang, Cali bang at seventeen
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything",https://genius.com/Xzibit-everything-lyrics
Enjoy The Night,Napalm,2012.0,"We gon' get fucked up
Enjoy the night, enjoy the night
We gon' get fucked up
And that's alright, that's alright
Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way
Everything is ok
Baby lift your cup up
Enjoy the night, enjoy the night

Amsterdam to Tokyo longitude only I can know
Latitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino
I ain't come here to make no friends
Because I rather be feared than love
Scared to death that I move this mountain get to you with this shotgun slug
And I could never turn my back on the ways of life
I'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights
My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck
It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up
Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest
Line out two shots and I'm down six dark or light, but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit
Let's see how fucked up we all gon' get


Raised in the gutter bread getting butter
Face like her mother ass like she's southern
So much cash I just gotta laugh
Out in Paris smoking grass signing autographs
It's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring
If it's shining then I'm near it
It's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point
Pop another bottle roll another joint
And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG
I'm way too high to be low key
Better act like you know me


Girl if you wanna get some drunk dick you can come and get it from me
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this hennessey
But we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink big
Party like it's 99 put a one-nine before that bitch
We gon' sip until we get sick, we gon' blaze till we get licked
Call Earl the world spinning tell the lil' bitch ye we winning
The girl that you love is good in the beginning
Two good shots and now the girl sinnin'
Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts
More Mer'
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get",https://genius.com/Xzibit-enjoy-the-night-lyrics
Killer’s Remorse,Napalm,2012.0,"I'm sorry I met you
I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you
I'm sorry I murked you
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

Its funny how the same shit we laugh at
Could be the very same shit to get your bitch ass clacked
Your throat slit next now drown in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog too but shit I don't count that
I'm the Angel of Death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so Christian I'm so Muslim
Suicide bomb your mom crib if you push em
I'm parallel to Hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking?
And rappers running their mouth
They don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon

I'm sorry I met you
I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you
I'm sorry I murked you
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

I feel so guilty my hands are filthy
From decorating your face all over the building
I'll say it sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with your blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be calm
I won't tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong

Yeah, have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from where he once came?
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chalk that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi


Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
Now I'm so alone now you was my reason to carry my gauge or chrome out
So now I just zone out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we beyond that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down?",https://genius.com/Xzibit-killers-remorse-lyrics
Dos Equis,Napalm,2012.0,"I'm a plastic surgeon, fix your face
I got Nascar numbers, I was built to race
Gon' be a long hot summer, Hubble 'scope from space
It's the next best thing since bakin' soda and base
It ain't the grill or the hunt, it ain't the paper we chasin'
All these bitches that you came to toot is basically basic
I'm gettin' white boy wasted, I'm wakin' up with a porn star
She walk around naked like she my personal OnStar
Push one button and boom: ""Hey, baby, how can I serve you today?""
Pussy wet as a typhoon, ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate backstroke, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want, she get to makin' it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm 'bout to miss my flight
First class to London, fuckin' with you all night
But listen

Back up in this motherfucker, spendin' all my money in here
'Cause I don't care, blowin' kush in the air
Drivin' cars that look spaceships
Ridin' with models and spillin' Ace in the club
Showin' international girls how to throw up a dub
While my chain swing left to right
We came to party, we can do it all night
And my money never run out, we party 'til the sun out
We off Patrón shots, so you know we 'bout to dumb out

Wes, uncut, welcome him home
From BJ to YJ, now the G grown
One click of the wrist, the competitor gone
Flight patrol on your turf like the predator drone, whoa
Not to mention pit bull bully
Razor edge bloodline, Nutro fed fully
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for the fight
One flash, green lights mean run, hit on sight
Let's go to war now, rock the Luger steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
One finger slice, now you pay the price
Put your life on the line if you feel you're that nice
'Cause running bullshit over here'll get you shot
Stupid, I'm the truth, that's everything you not
X's mark the spot, that's everything that's hot
And walk right upon you and run everything you got

Back up in this motherfucker, spendin' all my money in here
'Cause I don't care, blowin' kush in the air
Drivin' cars that look spaceships

We came to party, we can do it all night
And my money never run out, we party 'til the sun out
We off Patrón shots, so you know we 'bout to dumb out

I-I hit 'em with a nuke 'cause they pussy and they scared to shoot
My niggas hit you with the 21-gun salute
I paratroop through your city, hit the club, recruit
Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I'm learned from the smartest
Treat a bitch like a bitch, treat a queen like a goddess
Accosted, bombarded, weighin' me down
Slide a razor through your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope by the boatload, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a choke-hold, deliver the rounds
I went from livin' with clowns to rockin' a crown
And protect myself, silence oppressed the sound
You was upper body violence, burn your jaw to the ground
Makin' how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Here and now make them dollars work, we smokin' that loud

Back up in this motherfucker, spendin' all my money in here
'Cause I don't care, blowin' kush in the air
Drivin' cars that look spaceships

The Gambler,Man vs Machine,2002.0,"Yeah.. welcome.. yeah.. huh.. there's plenty of room for everybody man..
Yeah.. bangin.. come on.. yeah.. look..

Huh, Stay in my lane like a hustla
Never hate a motherfucker, tolerate a motherfucker
To a certain extent
When it's on, it's over
Don't get no chance to get popping
Forgotten about you before your body cold in a coffin
Just another failed attempt, you fall through the cracks
Sure as God made man, the first man was Black
The Black man made pyramids and gangsta rap
That's all I know, cuz poppa didn't raise no rats
Face the facts not the fiction
I Build my empire from a pocket full of stones
And a fifth of ambition
Niggas wanna ball but they never wanna listen
So instead of coming up, they just, come up missin
My mission is to hit with precision, shake whole continents
Crush niggas' confidence, expose my dominance
Without no conflict, you'll never have progress
I'm sending this one out to all the neighborhoods and projects, I'm a

One shot gambler (Yeah) Two shot gambler (Come on)
Three-time felon with that itch for dough
These mad street (Whuttup) Got me puffin on dro'
I'm guilty (What) Tryna make a living (Work it)
Thirty-eight albums and still no dollars (Come on)
And you wanna know why I hit the block for mo'? (Yeah)
These madd street (Uh) Got me puffin on dro' (Uh)
I'm guilty .. For tryna make a living

Bitch I ain't tryna holler at you (nah)
I'm just wanna drink, smoke, fuck and toss a couple dollars at you
I'm fightin dirty, I'll take thirty of you motherfuckers
I'm throwing cheapshots, low-blows and suckerpunches
I'm not for the games, I'm not in the mood
Not to be confused with dudes that fumble and lose
Xzibit move when I hear oppurtunity knockin
But I'mma shoot straight through the door if you comin with problems
It's too crowded at the bottom, too lonely at the top
Ain't no inbetween, trust me, like it or not
We gon' be here forever like cops and roaches
Do not approach us, ferocious, we pop them toasters, nigga

I'mma have to hit the block, then around to my hoes
I got a haze, two trays, and a change of clothes, cuz
Pimpin' ain't easy y'all,it's too sleazy
Too greasy, and I can't take it easy!


Everytime I try to get out
I get dragged right the fuck back in, it's like I'm never gon' win
Nigga got the whole world on his back
Over react, matter fact we act like when animals attack
I know, pussy sells faster than crack, ambassador rap
Twist back your salary cap, who fuckin with that?
Welcome to the X games, enjoy my pain
Inhale my smoke, it's hard not to cough or choke
Motorola nigga up the old fashion way
This ain't rap, this is shit that I was born to say
Though lately I been having dillemas, with insignificant niggas
And half-ass rappers that think they can get it
We the Golden State, we keep the whole thing bouncing
Y'all move units, we move mountains
Y'all rap for bullshit, tryna be on T.V

Klack,Weapons of Mass Destruction,2004.0,"Strong Arm Steady, we ready, it's time to ball out
When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out
Industry tried to pigeonhole, I had to crawl out
Hear my name bein called out, nuclear fallout
Full body armor with bangers, we goin all out
Garbage bags in trunk of the car, it won't stall out
Hit you where you stay, hogtied, you gettin hauled out
Crush the whole car, it's well planned and thought out
Try to attain fame from beef, you went the wrong route
Scrape a 38 on your teeth, I knock 'em all out
I know you ain't fuckin with me dawg (c'mon NOW)
Underestimate, run up on, it's on now
Have your niggas plottin revenge and puttin songs out
Demise by design, blueprints is drawn out
Flood crack back in the hood, it's been a long drought
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about

KLACK - for the niggas that bang in the inner city and
KLACK - for the enemies creepin to come and get me
Be thankful, if you get away alive
You wouldn't kill or won't let nothin die, so keep it movin

Assassin, crosshairs, smile for the birdie (CLICK!)
Hit you long range, high powered, 30-30 shit
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel (woo!)
Knock the soul out of your body, stay plottin like Bin Laden
To swoop down and crash your party
All bark no bite (SHIIIT!) we don't bark nigga
We bite to the white then shake 'til the afterlife
Hard work and sacrifice, who's your daddy?
Make you wanna drop e'rything and move to Cali
We classic, go 'head, speak my name
And I'mma lay your ass down like the All Star game, c'mon


Sawed-off shotgun, shoot through your shoulderblade
Bitch-made niggas get, hit with a hand grenade
Blow up your Escalade, then I hit the road
And I'm back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke
Everytime, I use the element of surprise
With a gun that's big enough to make an elephant hide
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts
Get locked but, when I'm released I'm back at it
See, Mitch know the time, in front of me the birdie and
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we
Came a long way from po-lice chasin us
For dope in our socks and angel dust

Everything matte black, colder than a six pack
You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do
Now put your hands up in the air like I'm about to shoot
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothin' to fear
We have nothin' to lose, pressure applyin' the rules
Bust on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs
Every bad bitch you can think of
Swagged out, loced out, flamed on, purve out
Shit faced from shots, your words come slurred out
Better put the word out, modified and mediocre
I'ma bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers
You can fuck around, rounds get to flyin'

I finish off what you started, terror, I tear you apart
I am not for them games, I'm the climb to the change
Thread the eye of the needle, that means accurate aim
That means I can arrange heinous and hideous things
I'm the sickness you feel, seconds from poppin' a vein
Paranormal presence that people can never explain
Why deal with the devil when dealin' with you is the same?
I got a proposition for all you bitches listenin'
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion
Give you what you've been missin'
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system
I got a fetish for fuckin' over my opposition

Standin' tall, still callin' shots from behind the wall
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my group
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do
Make movements, monumental, I done made some improvements
You can check my credentials, told to never pursue it
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit
Dreams battered and broken, never breakin' my spirit
Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future
Ain't no time like the present, leave the past and excuses

Now tell me what you think you is now

Slap the shit out a nigga tryna copy my style)

I got cars, many switches, many hoes and many bitches
Many bodies that's buried in holes of many ditches
Many, many homes, plenty chrome up on my whip
Plenty stop for you
Make me run up on your block and cock the semi
Ready, any nigga front, I hold it steady
I cock back, pop the ratchet and spill your spaghetti
Properties or blocks, we control 'em
Many, many Glocks, know how I kill all your soldiers, Freddy
My machete will cut niggas like I ain't really like 'em
Then carve a nigga meat deep like I'm killin' a bison
Tyson, animal instinct the way I will beat you
Got many shots and plenty spots for them bullets to eat you
See-through, them holes them bullets'll leave in between you
It seems you got left to die slow all up inside the venue

Hit you in the stomach with somethin'

I'll have your bones start crackin' and bustin'
To my women who be workin' them jeans with fat asses
Rich Itala heels, Roberto Cavali glasses
Come to my hideout, let me pimp your ride out
Hit your backside, tear your spine out and slide out
Yeah, 'cause my grind don't quit
I'm a walkin' franchise with them extra clips
I keep the bankroll thick, do lines so sick
That you can cut 'em with a razor blade, sniff the shit, come on

Then I put one right in ya head
Now tell me what you think you is now
(A top dollar biller, a Rottweiler, a killer
Slap the shit out a nigga tryna copy my style)

I tell you, no lie
Bitch nigga, you gon' die
Kill or be killed or get bodied just because you walked by
Nigga be still 'fore the trigger go off and a shot fly
And the shit'll be ill, if the shot turn your stomach to a pot pie
Nigga, we spill a lil liquor for the homie, muhfucka
We still'll make a nigga leak blood, 'til he need a refill
You tryna be a tough guy, and complicate what I build
Somebody don't beat the shit out this muthafucka, we will

Asthmatic, dramatic, fold you like a Kraftmatic
Heavy metal press hittin' your chest like a train wreck
Command respect, throw it one time for your set on deck
Niggas you never forget
I set up precedents, homie, you never snitch, hide the evidence
Dummies dig ditches, they dyin' for dead presidents
The big screen make 'em seem large like an elephant
But in real life, they so soft and so delicate

Thought you was a tough guy?
Then I put one right in ya head
Now tell me what you think you is now

Back 2 the Way It Was,Weapons of Mass Destruction,2004.0,"Yeah.. yo.. c'mon
Ride wit me, lemme take you somewhere y'knahmean?

My father was a soldier, my mother was a rider
I was born wit my fists balled up, I'mma fighter
Inspired, a real rhyme writer
Get past the past the future looks brighter
But, I wanna get it back to the way it was
Exchange blows, elbows and it was still love
A better time, better place in space
Cause nothin can erase, shame tat' like my nigga Chase
Cause Bigga B will never be replaced, right
And I'mma scream it to the whole fuckin human race
Get a bar, get a taste
Enforce the muscle to ya hustle and ya did it with grace
Cause real niggas don't save face, they make movements
Back to the time when hip-hop was music
When N.W.A. got booed at the Apollo
Broke ""Straight Outta Compton"" and the whole world followed
Cause right now hip-hop is hollow
With no substance, X-Man with the roughness
Cause success can suck sometimes
And many of us the way we act, we even lost our minds

You can hold your breath, 'til your blue in the face
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on (now sing the song wit me)
You can speculate, on every breath I take
But you can never ever take my place
I stay strong whether right or I'm wrong
Through the struggle I will live on

Back to the day when Cooley was High
Hustle big like Butch in the Y-B-I
We did it 'n died, the gang still multiplied
Sock yo windpipe, cut yo air supply
Hypnotized, not by the glitz 'n glamour
So fuck them cameras, all I need is clips and hammers
The X-Man said that the first rhyme out
Were my fans worth my time? The first line out, so
Here we are eight years strong and still movin'
Groovin with a reputation ya can't ruin
I wanna take it back how it used to be
Five thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity


Was it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame
That made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?
Played those games nigga when I was younger in life
'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife
Lose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us
Ya can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us
When times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic
Never been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard
But I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor
I never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster
I move in silence, speak with violence
Think with science, live free and walk with lions
Cats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat
It takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Pounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about
It's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth
It's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out
Don't let the things that you can't change stress you out
Cause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son
And change the world with the power of one c'mon",https://genius.com/Xzibit-back-2-the-way-it-was-lyrics

Procrastination like masturbation, your fuckin yourself
So we gonna move on em quickly (what)
No chance to think about coming back
Chain smoke em, turn they lungs black
See I was raised to love black, but sometimes
Black folks wanna sweat you harder than the one-time
Never participate in dumb, deaf and blind shit
Plus I got my little man, so daily I'm reminded
The ride only gets rougher (right)
But I'll be damned if me and my niggas suffer
Smuggle this motherucker with the raw shit, I'm blessed wit
Lookin at the world, burned for the young and the desperate
Showed heart, but got cardiac arrested
More than a nigga with an image and a press kit
The wreck hits, creates desert land, desolate
The whole intent to rock the shit, keep the herb lit

Everyday I puts in down in LA, hustle in this
Assassin lyricist, serious, muscle in this
I call the bets, I know we got coordinates on more games to wreck
We blaze shows, never no Half Step
Tactics, B-Boys, no games no antics
No false images, no bullshit semantics
We planned this, for hundreds of thousands
Reignin' on they brains with lyrics, from the mountains
Don't contemplate what you can't even demonstrate
Defari lottery draft pick, never the second rate
Nigga who wanna hate but front like its all great
I gots no time for these emotional niggas, I gots to motivate
Moves to make, best rhyme straight
That's for the old school, this here's our year, it's time to elevate
Handle this, don't hesitate got money to make
Push maximum levels from the Golden State

Handle your business before your business handles you

Haitians stay amazed and confused like this was algebra
I'm scoutin the, best land for property
Never sloppily, picture someone stoppin me
From gettin mine, line after line
And you wonder why I call these fake niggas Miller
They think they Genuine; I'm startin to shine, imported Italian
With a custom made Herut charm as my medallion

Seem like, I recite the same prayer every night
Watch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight
And fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight
Till then, lick it to the chin, let it begin
We could break bread or break skin; and watch me send it
Try not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it
And my directions, suggest for your own protection

Ain't nothin above it, we stomp y'all religiously

Persistant and insistant on doin it our way
Do you really wanna fuck with Danze? (c'mon)

Double clutch in his hands, my nigga

Make the world flame! Face the Fame-ster, part, Fame-ster
Y'all niggas akin to God and gangsters
(YOU SEE IT!) It's the M dot, to the O dot, to the P
With X to the Z hot, what's happenin?


Hunt down, hurt, hang and hate the hater
Watch how you rise, fall and thank me later
Look in my eyes, I should not have to say it
Look alive, these streets is complicated

AOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! You got problems with us? Start poppin
I get in yo' chest like anthrax, vaccine couldn't stop it
Let's move on 'em (aoww) must move on 'em
Rush in, gun-bustin, black seven plus tools on 'em
Never snooze on 'em, I'm short, haven't got room for 'em
I send you to God with no shoes
CLUELESS! Real G's run this, we rule this
If you wanna get into some gangsta shit, let's do this
(YES SIR!) No question, no half-steppin
Streets is my profession, heat in my posession
Hollow-tips is the answer; look around you see the signs
Say ""NO SMOKIN"" but our guns got cancer!

Raise the stakes high, I solidify

I look you in your grill and I laugh inside
Niggas always perpetrating like they down to ride
But please don't try to tell me what I can not see
What's the real definition of a fake MC?
Muthafuckas only rapping since '93 and expect all props
Them gettin dropped like hot rocks
""So stop what they doing cause I'm about to ruin""
Like Shock-G, get turned to stone tryin to rock me
I separate my thought process from stress, 24 tracks inside my brain
Tyrin to maintain
I bang shit without no gang or Jherri curls
I seem like Kadeem in a whole different world
It's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves, forgettin who they are
When they try to be that superstar
You don't understand, it's all in the game plan, exploit the art
And watch hip-hop fall apart
But I'ma do my part, and stay true
And keep breaking down bitch niggas like you
[Verse 2: Hurricane Gee &

I'm not the type to play games or drop names
I just maintain and burn rappers out the frame
Doin my part to stay true
And keep breaking down bitch niggas like you
And above all else, I represent it for myself, leavin muthafuckas stretched out
Or better yet X-ed out
Xzibit accelerate, I rush it to the extreme like nicotine
Never get me clean from your bloodstream
We all can't bust, so do it how you must
But if you hustle, avoid gettin rushed with handcuffs plus
In God we trust but don't trust us
We just add to the ashes, then pick up the dust

Try to play the back and look intense, you need to hit a fence
You don't want none of this hands-on experience
I'm no the type to play games or drop names
I just maintain and drop rappers out the frame

I bring it to the ruffest toughest mic killers
And you wannabe niggas
And you burn bitches, type vicious
Imitating Hurricane flow for riches

Doobie rap style getting bucked
More freaky than your last good fuck
Milkin you like ba ba pieces
Meetin niggas lyrical wishes
Writin rhymes and washin out dishes
Flowin with the Likwid, wicked
Representin' with my nigga Xzibit
And we gonna do it, and do it, and do it
And do it till you satisfied!

Since a juvenile callin'
Shots in the dorm
Moms said you better get right
Or shake the spot
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone
Like pop
Stashin' the rocks by the gats
With the Gs
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!
I don't fight the feelin'
Gotta hustle with a passion
Comin' cross state to put you down
With some action
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets
Remininsin' younger days
Over gangsa ass beats
And I
Hit the weed
Til myeye balls bleed
While my life is corrupted
By lust and greed
Serve you anything from cocaine
Up to speed
I came with the drank
So here's five on the weed

See kids don't belong
Up in grown folks buisness

Sickness bear witness
Like tequlla without a chaser

Niggas guarenteed to drown

From the west coast underground

Never underestimate the power

Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle

Have smoke will travel

Unanimous decisions

It's going down
Once again everybody lay down
Run your money and the jewels
To the front without a sound

Glad to meet ya
Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain
Through ya speaka and hey
I walk around the hood lookin' looped
Strapped like a mothafuckin'
Desert strom troop
Niggas be like ""King Tila
How you get that Benz?""
By sending birds to Oklahoma City
To my friends
I slang my gangsta funk
Through the night
Sometimes I fight
Like I'm the ghost of Eric Wright
Compton is where I dwell
It's like hell
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers
In a spell
And all my homies live lives
Like crooks
Rich and infamous
Hoes wanna look but get shook
Cause we don't trust you hoes
You'll have a nigga fucked up
With a bullet through his clothes
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live

Ladies and gentlemen
Undivided attention
Xzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson
It's the...
Most dangerous things next to grizzles
Unsolved mysteries
Xzibit hit you penetentary style
Quick sharp and straight to the neck
I'm heavy on your chest
I'm all up in your life
Like stress
The coast that resides to your left
Whre niggas perpitrate
And catch a fate worse than death
And like Cyanide I'm hard to detect
Got more desighns and stragiht lines

He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)

Fix me up, now my owner wanna slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools tripping

Stand Tall,Napalm,2012.0,"Sometimes it all just come together, you know?
I put my city on my back, now
And push the haters in the background
Together we walk, but divided trough the struggle, we fall
Got my city on a map, now
That’s why I could never back down
Never back down, show ‘em through it all
You gotta stand tall

To all of my friends, enemies and affiliates
Burn the back wood, burn it down to your fingertips
Let the whole world recognize this accomplishment
You couldn’t have told me none of this back in ’96
The ability to crawl up out of bottomless pits
This is our time I’m spending mine rockin' this bitch
I still remember the very moment I was enlisted
I studied on the sadistic, gangster is worth the business
And when there’s blood in the streets from my brothers and sisters
They wanna debate on television about the victim
Right or wrong, if Treyvon was my little man
I would take a chainsaw to Zimmerman


For all the moments I wasted on making others happy
Attack me, I’m bulletproof, hack me, I'll send a virus through
I've never lied to you, still roll with a chosen few
Spit every word and I mean it, meanin' I'll really body you
‘Cause I would rather be in hell than a jail cell
I’m hancock, superhero slamming cocktails
I never fail, don’t try to patronize me
Alert and painfully aware of everything in my surroundings
I am shamefuly shining, never touched the silver lining
The only cross that I bear is covered with some fucking diamonds
I hear my city calling, here come the juggernaut
Wit' twelve hundred soldiers in the parking lot


So, failure ain't an option
How do you think I made it out that corner apartment?
Turn my corner to my market, and now I target the same Niggas
That taught on all that dumb shit
Because when the gun clicking
That bullet leaving can’t get that life back
Karma is a bitch and believe me, she’ll get it right back
They say that success is the best revenge
But who really wins if we all die in the end
If I had it all, then I probably wouldn’t pray the same
And the club that I come from sticks the debt with the pain
My name good in every corner in my city
You don’t believe me, then come fuck with me",https://genius.com/Xzibit-stand-tall-lyrics
25 to Life (Life Soundtrack),LIFE - Music Inspired By the Motion Picture ,1999.0,"Yo to my people doing time, Xzibit, Juvenile, y'all need to
 Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on
Bring the heat

Look, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain
Stuck with a thousand street hustlers
Down on they luck
Repeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'
And for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'
But I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense
If I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground
Fox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down
By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual
Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General
Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal
Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal
I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys
I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne
See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth
Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside
(Wyclef) 

You got me fucked up I'm innocent
Look I ain't do shit you don't want to hear my side
But you believin' that bitch
You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'
Cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go
Where my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya
Y'all go tell that to my mother & my father
But they gon' cuss ya out so don't you even bother
You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'
Cause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks
Look the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball
This is my third felony plus my third strike
Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life


QU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I shed light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'
Niggas throwin' Tyson back in another year
Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at you bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight
'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts
And turn killers into girl scouts works of art
Picasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier


Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short
Still the thought of murderer true to the sport
I bang with the best in niggas career criminals
Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out
Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now
Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial
New case, new trial, I don't give a fuck
I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts
Ready to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die
But what powered your honor to hit me with 25 fuck 'em
I know that real recognize every hustle
And die with they niggas in the struggle, ya feel me?

Oh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted
Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene
Huntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween
Mashed down in fatigues servin' the fiends
Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve
In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess
Ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets
No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts
Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug
You 'bout to die thug!
Call the President I'm blowin' up ya residence
Spill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence
Protestors outside screamin' free Gotti
Guard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty

Something More,Napalm,2012,"Something more, something more than faith
Something more, something more than fairytales
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

I designed an oasis, wide open spaces
Butt naked bitches having sexual relations
Major operation, let me take conversations
Sensitive intel, pay attention to detail
Yeah, design the flat, not your vital signs
AC, DC, alkaline, whichever type of battery you got in your back
Gon' be removed when the clips get slapped
You and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back

Something more, something more than faith
Something more, something more than fairytales
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

My hip hop is outstanding, outlasting
All of these dwarf stars, they fizz a lot fast week
Burn like the sun and you suck like a black hole
Suck in my style and get over my flagpole
These colors don't run, we attract to
Drama like madness, you wanna get your head flew
Incredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme
I'm not the average, no in fact I'm
Super rap killer, extremely great spitter
Make a dope, hit a door, solve the queen's riddler
Sinister, ill enough to bang with the sickest
So get up and get down with the sickness
This is something more than just songs
I wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with
Better lines than them, to crush their dreams
And attempts at my sport when I do this thing

Something more than faith
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

What you know about death, money and sacrifice?
What you know about people scheming to take your life?
I'm tryna tell you, what know about these Cali G's?
That mister penitentiary invested movement on a bigger better day
What you know about the harder man?
We paint the art of war to decorate the promised land
You understand, it's in my nature not to walk away
Cause I'm a beast, my beats'll open up your chest and face
Call the police, it's not the same and I don't give a fuck
I speak the truth and now my catalogues are living trust
Now give it up and get it, take it at gun point
We cut-throat niggas in what point
You gonna realize we came for

Loud & Clear,Restless,2000.0,"Yeah
Addicted to life, had to pay a heavy-ass price
Sacrifice worth waitin' on the platinum and ice
I'm precise with the merchandise, came back like Christ
To change the game, while y'all niggas remain the same
Clear the lane, comin' through like Kobe, you can't hold me
You can't stop me, ever since I dropped ""Paparazzi""
I done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit
Like every idiot that can spit be droppin' a hit
I transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted
Shadowbox, detox, my own worse critic
It's like tryin to squeeze water from rocks
I negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a Glock
Sick of niggas screamin' they hot, but really they not
Beatin' you all to the ground like six L.A. cops
Put your fist up in the air if you ever been shot
And lived to tell about it, never leavin' home without it
C'mon

There's no one out there
For us, to fear, I'll say it loud and clear
(We ain't scared of none you motherfuckers)
Who can say they're close, to us
Speak now and you'll be brought to tears

They probably saw me on the 91 East, gettin off on Central
With the rag back, lookin' like life's so simple
Tela take a loss, still floss, all bets
If Trife can't cover the house, call X
Likwit crew brothers, Blues Brothers
Move somethin', make killers do somethin', f'real
The bitch-made often politic with the skill
Now shit's all twisted, unlisted
Guns fixed it, best not speak about the Likwit
We gifted, twenty-four hours and still lifted
(*X*: Bitch keep your vagina) We drunk and ain't interested
Bitches come a dime and a dove, we ain't trippin' it
Standin' at the bar, soft-styled in the cut
""Ooh, boo wait, I think you had too much!""
Bitch what? Act right and pour it in a cup
The West and Eastside keep smokin' them blunts, niggas

Let's get with it, I was born to trip
Stay on the lookout, ain't no time to slip
We ain't for games and shit
Change your spot, 'cause we're known to dip
No time for chasin' hoes
I'm on a mission 'cause my cash is low
There's no need to speak on those
Doggy rags are the gangsta's clothes

There's two sides of my family, both sides from the ghetto
Pops Finnish choco-late, moms Mississippi yellow
Caramel, Cherokee black man, with a pedigree of excellence
Together we rise, no time for seperateness
My grandfather Snake was a Jake, or a jack
Of a smack to a bird who don't know how to act
Straight hustler, Mississippi moonshine smuggler
Good ol' wrangler in his day with that attitude of ""Fuck ya""

Built to run forever, X the infinite
First line of defense to smash through the immigrants
Can't straddle the fence, it's all or nothin'
Close the curtain, shut down your whole production
Don't be scared, be prepared, niggas do be bustin'
Without thinkin' I mastered the art of hard drinkin'
Yo, you wanna stop the X try your best
I'm still fuckin with your pockets like the IRS, so yo

There's no one out there
For us, to fear I'll say it loud and clear
(Yeah, we ain't scared of none of you motherfuckers)
Who can say they're close to us
Speak now and you'll be brought to tears
(Front line all the time motherfucker)
Gather all around, to see how we display our vicious skills

Scandalous Bitches,Full Circle,2006.0,"She was a brown skin ebony honey that love hip-hop
Cut off tank-top, she make your whole face drop
Hotbox, like it or not, she don't care what I got
She got her own knot dealin' in stocks
And in the backwoods she plans to dust me off
Suck me off, and then say I must be off
Tryin' to smoke with X, the Cali kush was makin' her cough
She must hate wearin' her clothes, she keeps takin 'em off
At the Palms Hotel on a friday night
Attack each other like animals 'til the sky turn bright
Make it a - night to remember, she went tellin' her sista
Then her sista turned around and told the shit to Melissa
Then Melissa got my number, started sendin' me pictures
In all type of different positions, man this bitch on a mission
Listen, a man is a man, gon' handle his business
I ain't a bad guy, just dealin' with scandalous bitches
I remember when Xzibit used to push in a Caddy
I met this chick from the Valley, she said she wanted me badly
Now this is common in Cali because the homies is savy
Bitches be givin' money to niggas and callin 'em Daddy
She in a brand-new Lexus, just moved from Texas
She came to California to model and be that next bitch
Takin' naked pictures tryin' to gain more acceptance
Maybe get some jobs, try to politic some connections
I said appreciate for X to the Z
My homie picked through my trash instead of talkin' to me
He fell in love with her ass, and while she casin' his place
Tryin' to tell another nigga what he got up in his safe
About the big hundred stacks and them bricks to match
Forever watchin' his back, therefore he never relax
And when her nigga attack, he got a slug in his britches
He ain't a bad guy, just dealin' with scandalous bitches
I met this girl from the 'Nati, I got along with her daddy
I made it up in my mind this is the girl I'mma marry
Now when you wanna get married the preparation is scary
You want your weight to get carried, you want your skeletons buried
She moved out to California next to me in a hurry
Her reputation was dirty, but yo that didn't disturb me
I want to stop the insanity, try to have me a family
Started checkin' my phone and brought her back to reality
Left her ring on the dresser, adios motherfucker
I'm travelin' home from the road, I hear she fuckin' with Usher
Now Usher don't even know me but I got love for the homie
Even though everybody around me be thinkin' he corny
She denied everything, said the rumors was phony
On the phone cryin', she love me, said she wanted to hold me
(""Yo he ain't shit to me Alvin, I was just into his album
That was some bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm better without him"")
So I'm off to Miami, got invited to party
By Mr. Raymond himself, yo I ain't hatin' nobody
Now when we walk in the party, yep, guess who I see
Lyin' bitch said she was callin' from N.Y.C
He started wipin' the sweat off of her face and her chest
And then she gave him a peck, and then she looked to the left
And when she seen it was X, she started cryin' and trippin'
And dude was lookin' confused, the scene it couldn't be written
Now he just pluckin' his chickens, I ain't gon' sock him or diss him
I'm from the West Coast, where niggas don't be fightin' for bitches
A little over-dramatic, in Rome I called him a faggot
In front of millions of people, funny but shouldn't have done that
I was makin' a joke, I didn't mean to offend
Like when I introduced Destiny's Child as Boyz II Men
Listen, a man is a man, gon' handle his business
I ain't a bad guy, just dealin' with scandalous bitches

 Yoo! shit it's goin' down?
 Hey, let me tell you something
I got some ladies over here, you know...
 Hi Xzibit!
 What's up?
 He he, see what I'm saying
They were just trying, you know, to tell you hello and shit
But listen why don't you do this
When you're done over there, why don't you come here and shit
You know what I'm saying?
That way they can tell you hello on person
 Ah alrihgt, you want me to bring you somethin'
 Hey, bring yourself, I'm sure they can handle the rest
You know what I mean?
 Yeah yeah, alright, I'll be over there in a minute
 Peace!
 Alright


It's a lazy Sunday night
Xzibit posted at the lab
Gettin' high as a kite
Proceed to rolll the light
It's real tight
In a paper Philly Blunts I don't need
It might fuck off the taste
Of this bomb ass weed
My nigga Tango and Breeze
Came thru we blaze a few
Together bored as fuck
Niggas down for whatever
Break left from the bomb
Phone call from Ron Hightower
Shower at his crib in a hour
All the women involved drop drawers
Don't say nothin'
Just a lota nuttin'
Fuckin' plus dick suckin'
Goddamn who was that?
Half black with the fat ass
Too much to ask if you can put them on the glass
(For me)
My name's Xzibit
I ain't' tryin' to spit game
Just tell me your name
And the proportions of your frame
(38-26-32)
That's right
Xzibit now has it poppin' on Sunday night

I don't wanna save 'em
Pay em' or buy clothes
All we really wanna do
Is try to fuck these hoes


You knew the game
And you still ended up on your back...

Bitches get laid like tracks
Break it down like that
With stacks of profilactics
Got ill tactics just to get you on the matress like yo

With minimal conversation
No time wastin'
Only hard penetration
Gettin' shiners on recliners
Cummin' in your faces
Stop! Get on top
I take your mind different places
Won't be satisfied till I hit every race
Color and creed in deed
All I need is weed a fly steez
Who ain't afraid to take the lead
A little dirt on your knees
Looked over saw Breeze
Laid out on the couch about to let it all out
Nigga that's the kinda shit that I'm talkin' about

I don't wanna save em'
Pay em' or buy clothes
All we really wanna do
Is try to fuck these hoes",https://genius.com/Xzibit-hit-and-run-part-ii-lyrics

 Well let me ask you this...

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?

Yo we gettiin' restless me and D.O.G.s
Never pretendin' rather we sendin' a very clear message
Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump
I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump
Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversible damage
It's the long-awaited anticipated Likwit MC
Bombin' first cause I feel it's better to give then receive
You better believe
Xzibit stays savage above the average
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cabbage
But see all that irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate
I dance with the devil for the hell of it
Burning down your lavish landscape on digital tape
Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?

Niggas we null and void 
I get swole like a keyloid
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure
So open up your door to me Cause if it's closed
I'm a brakin' in with some pantyhose
Over the mic
So you don't know who I sound like
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight
It's not permitted by the right
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan till I threw you in the back of a
Van
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet
For those with plans to clone me thee original
It can't be done I'm digital (digital)

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me knowhatI'msayin'?

Yo who wanna come see the hard rock?
The nonstop green block yo whole block receive speed knot
You need not
Get brave my bullets never graze
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone
So better get off on your own bitch
Rollin' chrome shit tryin' to own shit
I was molded, after the best that the streets had to offer
The author of my own destiny
So I suggest you stop stressin' me
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no timeouts
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape
Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

I don't want niggas soundin' like me

Could you loan me a dollar? Bitch, I can't do that
Got a flight in an hour, got my bags all packed
Bring it in for the huddle a hundred and fifty racks, POW!
Want me to take it to the club and throw it on the ground?
Instead I take it buy a business, make it double down

Better pack a extra clip

(Yeah, Welcome to my planet)",https://genius.com/Xzibit-my-life-my-world-lyrics
Chamber Music,40 Days & 40 Nightz,1998.0,"The official representative, LAC
This is prophecy manifested by X to the Z
Victory, strike a B-Boy stance in khaki pants
Never get along like red and black ants, advance
When you're staring at this concrete that move like liquid
Like a nigga without legs, I ain't trying to kick it
Too much to finish, a menace, without enough time
My mind only give punchline, you probably thinking of the wrong kind
Cause if it jokes, nigga know
The kind that drop on your eyes, your ears, your nose, and your throat
I promote self-defense. not dollars and cents
Kick it with scholars and pimps, you just the last part over the fence
Assed out in the open, while you was hoping that Xzibit was second rate
But I refuse to make just another record in the crate
I think not, got bee-bops
I bring it to your house like Pink Dot

Today we are on the streets of South Central Los Angelos, a fight for survival
We have people that are conditioned not to expect to live past age thirty
They no longer. Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous

Stand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean
When I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines
Hit and decapitate the bird case, featherweight
Critical thinking, while you add water to concentrate
Xzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box 'em in
Seal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen
Xzibit run with a regiment of veterans
I only like to come out late night, like Dave Letterman
Time for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick
Calling me a hater cause I don't ride dicks
Read my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips
Love the sound of clips when I load my shit
Chamber Music, this is for the ones with stone-face
That catch you at the right time in the wrong place
We unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice
Take away your life like three strikes
Yeah, come on, Chamber Music

So now Xzibit got a little money, I think it's funny
How motherfuckers think I'm supposed to share like Sonny
Clarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat
You don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique
Accomplish more in one day than you can do in a week
The X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean
End of all things manifested in flesh
Fuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class
Catch a roadrash, all you smell is hash
Chronic mix, bumping the Liks
Addicting like a Heron fix
Bear-arm from here to a hundred-twenty meters
Get black-balled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald
The assassin, brother who came blastin'
Take it without askin', rappers is all fashion
Xzibit keep mashing through
Got any lost words? I got two
Try ""fuck"" and ""you"", like that",https://genius.com/Xzibit-chamber-music-lyrics
Harder,Man vs Machine,2002.0,"Ah, I don't wanna hear shit
Get off ya motherfucking ass

And we bringing it to you live, COME ON!
Golden state, what... come on, what bitch
New Shit! Ha, come on, yeah Ras Kass blaze that shit up
Xzibit, break it down slam it, Jelly Roll

Show me a bitch and I'm a slay her like Sarah Michelle Gell-ie
Rap star, trash tellies blow up my sprint celly
Dare me, I tongue Halle Berry's belly
Show her a monster's ball, fuck it you tell me
Platinum, heavy 22 inch Pirellis
Jelly, it gets so ugly it gets scary
Haters act like under-age hoes so what's really-
Can't fuck wit y'all, paging R.Kelly (ooooohhh)
Oh, if the shoe fits buy a matching shirt
Ya nothing take ya face and attach dirt
Catch me and my niggas wit strychnine
Strictly constrict 9 triggas disfigure ya figure
Our figgas got bigger, niggas the same
Menace to society and y'all done made me Kane
Can't extort us faggot, you bust we bust
In God we trust but we paying at dusk, biatch!

Yella, yizzel, shaft shizza-lean
Fuck what y'all talking about, this shit clean
That's why we filthy rich behind the scenes
Game spitters with helmets and shoulder pads on the hitters
Bullshit so far what this game sent
We here to burn it down open bar entertainment
Taking the work clipping the clientele on raw
Lactose intolerant but I still sell
Game enough to mash on the coach like Sprewell
Don't salt there hoes flows ain't got that sea smell
Overstand under surveillance, Ben Savage-
Can't come to the town terrorizing we been Laden
Been beat heavyweight beefs and went passage
Back to the blockmates and it's safe to unlock cakes
King sizzel makin' bank, shake the spizzle
We don't make it drizzle we rain in the G-state

Don't you think this shit is for fun (NO!)

La la la la la la la la (yeah)

Feel the adrenaline, feel the rush
The effects of the compound the ammo dump
Doc Dre don't fuck with punks
We all thump like Maximus, stop fucking with us
Take a ride inside the home of hands-on hip-hop
Speak what you believe and hope you don't get shot for it
Ghetto poets, show it if you got one
A hot one, with ass and rap like a shotgun
I can write to the sound of the sunset
Smith & Wesson, I use words as a weapon
Gun sling my dreams I reign supreme
And fiend for the next challenge, knocking you off balance
Look, I been through the worst, avoided the hearst (Survived!)
Starving to death and dying of thirst (alive!)
Here in the flesh, elope with the profoc-
The answer, the solution, the remedy, the anecdote

Don't you think this shit is for fun (NO!)

Invade My Space,Full Circle,2006.0,"This, cannot continue
We must go, our separate ways
Without you, I can do better
But first these words, I have, to, say
It's not, that I don't hear you
When you scream, and curse, my, name
It's just that I, don't feel you
Nigga you, invade, my space

YEAH!
Blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up
I'm alge-ballin, dumb niggas cain't add it up
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin up (yeah)
All these rappers comin out, ain't nobody showin up
Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at
You the king of the streets? Well I ain't heard none of that
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, (Did it My Way)
I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide
Recognize, lost of a lot of love when my momma died
Did a gang of shhhhit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive
Fishburn yellin wake up, open up my eyes
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize
And criticize when you on your grind so I realized

This, cannot continue
We must go, our separate ways
Without you, I can do better
But first these words, I have, to, say
It's not, that I don't hear you
When you scream, and curse, my, name
It's just that I, don't feel you
Nigga you, invade, my space

Go ahead spit it out, that's right, get it out
So I can respond, nigga FUCK what you talk about
Drop like a guillotine, money over everything
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship
Came a long way from the place that I started from
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?
Hate manifest from the inside out
The shit starts in your heart then spill out your mouth
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out
I see you tryin to stand up but you don't stand out (ha ha ha!)
Now that I found that my path is original
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle (yeah)
I'm not like you, but you think we identical
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal

This, cannot continue
We must go, our separate ways
Without you, I can do better
But first these words, I have, to, say
It's not, that I don't hear you
When you scream, and curse, my, name
It's just that I, don't feel you
Nigga you, invade, my space

Three wheels lock it up, ammo stock it up
It's not for niggas cause George Bush comin after us
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go
All my people fightin for they soul, you are not alone
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, over kill shit
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit
You know that young shit, the ""Hey nigga where you from"" shit
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand
Let's part ways and, then pray for better days
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to say

This, cannot continue
We must go, our separate ways
Without you, I can do better
But first these words, I have, to, say

I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell

I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggas sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggas have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, ""NOT GUILTY!!!""

Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell

Cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber Glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggas is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields

I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell

Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggas down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast

Chea! Yeah

We got (yo bitch) ridin' shotgun
(Hoooooo) Yeah, spread it out, spread it out, spread it out, go, headed out
Yeah, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, chea!
Yo

I'm heavy hearted
Heavy handed misunderstandings turn to permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in the 'wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
I'ma rhyme for my people, give my people a voice
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spillin' my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron lung, drop atom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke till the sack is gone, niggas on they grind
Put my motherfuckin' records on
So they can relate through the hate and the pain
Through the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathin' one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So now

Well spread me out, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
It go:
(Hoooooo) Yeah... And you can't get none
(Hoooooo) You don't want none, you can't get none
Spread the fuck out or catch these hot ones

I try not to get involved with the nonsense
I'm from the time where you couldn't post comments
Couldn't hide behind the computer
Catch a fatal, get shot by the shooter
A barracuda for Buddha
I maneuver through the manure
Ignorin' the allure, the illusion
My bad, sorry for all the confusion
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done
Let the saga continue, bring it back on the one
I'm coming back with a gun, 'cause that's all that I know
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go
Never takin' it slow, in my profession you need aggression
A weapon, you can brandish at your own discretion
And a hero just a sandwich, nigga, what's your preference?
I chose balance, now I'm headed in the right direction
Executive decisions, now my family is good
Make it well understood, put it back where it should... be

Well spread me out, nigga
Yeah, yeah
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
It go:
(Hoooooo) ...And you can't get none
(Hoooooo) You don't want none, you can't get none
Spread the fuck out or catch these hot ones

This go for all my people, people who see we equal
I feel it comin', it's dark, God protect us from evil
We've been sold an illusion, cockamamie confusion
People constantly losin', we suffer everywhere
Enough with all this swagger, parties and bodybaggin'
We in recession, we starvin', let me show you what's happenin'
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights
She make you wanna not ever never come home at night
But see now there you go, off with that strippin' ho
While your woman is wonderin' where does all your money go
You try to make it rain, maybe rock you a chain
Maybe get you some brain, from bitches everywhere
Pussy nigga, you lame
Get on top o' yo' game
Feed your family, mayne
This is simple and plain
Children retain, remember, livin' up out the pain
That's when they 'curse your name, they proceed to do the same

Yeah, so spread me out, nigga
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out

Legends Never Die,Serial Killers Vol. 1,2013.0,"(Intro)
Legends never...
(Ea$y Money)
Ever since the day I got old
They told me I would never make it this long
Now years after the day that I’m gone
They’ll be playing my songs and my name will live on
When everybody thought that I was insane
I stood tall after all that have came
So let the good Lord call on my name
‘Cause I done rep I’m working the game
(Hook-Ea$y Money & Xzibit)
We never die
Never die!
We just live on
Live on, live on
We never die
Never die!
We just live on
(Xzibit)
Yea, I’m a cowboy steppin clear
With a pistol pointblank behind your right ear
Yea because fear is not a option
Say my name 3 times – I appear with a shotgun
Now what you motherfuckers want from me?
I’m from the gutter, I’m medicated by drug money
Take everything, there ain’t nothing else you could take from me
Never break from you niggas, swinging until my hands bloody
Time flies, dreams die, people lose faith
Tryna hide behind a lie with a straight face
Buzz kill, boots on the ground ‘cause I’m straight lace
Fuck love, never needed love in the first place
(Hook-Ea$y Money & Xzibit)
Legends never... die...
Never die!
We just live on
Live on, live on
We never die
Never die!
We just live on
(B-Real)
So many doubted so little time
So many haters coming to mind
Later for waste ‘cause moments to bind
Because I would never look back and regretted this fucking life
Around, I do it for the ones who supported the dream
And making every second of their life as a part of my team
It take the heart of a lion, the crown of a king
Bring up a throne and you keep the frame in mind but you singing my songs
Still serial kill the bullshit, spit up the thrills
And if you will, you’re not the killer, for real I be dealing
The run of the mill, with no skill, top Billy the dun
That’s why I reply
(Hook-Ea$y Money & Xzibit)
Legends never... die...
Never die!
We just live on
Live on, live on
We never die
Never die!
We just live on
(Xzibit)
Yea, I was born to live forever
I am legend, gather my thoughts and line em up together
Feel like pulling my own Beretta put it to my head
Better days ahead, left for dead with my daily bread
Yea, I’ll cause a slaughter in your tabernacle
I storm your castle and guillotined your queen
Los Angeles to the rotten apple
I’m playing tackle
Giving concussions cold like going to war with the Russians
Starving like my ribs and my stomach is touching
I’m filthy as a pig, all this drinking and fuckin
It’s just my destiny til the death of me, stand and deliver
Confessions of an unapologetic serial killer

Legends never... die...
We just live on

Enemies,Man vs Machine,2002.0,"Yeah!
Aoww, aoww!

Sometimes I'm my own worst ENEMY
With friends like y'all, the fuck needs ENEMIES?
I beat, I stab, I kill my ENEMIES
Refuse to let you waste my ENERGY

I heard they callin me a immigrant; well this motherfuckin immigrant
Came to yo' city and started runnin shit
X is like the government, taxin that ass
Been harassed to the point that I'm ready to blast
And spend the rest of my life behind metal and glass
Never seen a nigga move so fast, cut you in half
Sick of all these threats, these bitches with no action
Hog-tie, watch you die and start laughin
And no longer will I sit back and let you disrespect the fact
That we elevated West coast rap
And bring shit back to the point ""X"" is all that they checkin for
In the clubs, the streets, the shows and the record stores
What more can you ask for, eat your heart out
Fall out with bitch niggas constantly callin my name out
I'm really not givin a fuck, you're pressin your luck
I'm a walkin warhead ready to self-destruct, so WHAT?!


My name feel like a slap in the face
My name feel like a gat in yo' waist
My name is all over the place
Erasin all misconceptions
I live my whole life with aggression bitch;
And I'm not stressin
Your words ain't workin I feel so much pressure
Padlock, chain around, neck no lesser
Sick of niggas runnin they mouth
It don't take much to get knocked out, round these parts when I start
Shit full clips get emptied, revenge WE
Move like the Secret Service, I ain't nervous
I just wanna tell the truth.. the whole truth
When I'm on the stand explainin how I had to shoot
Absolute domination, extreme mutilation
No hesitation, I'm a movin violation
So don't get hit in the street
Used to have friends and family, now I got nothin but beef
What the fuck?


So-and-so hate me, blah-blah gon' get me
If I gotta go, y'all niggas comin wit me
I'mma walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Cinderblock stock, shootin straight from the shoulder
Just too much shit in the air
Burn bridges you could never repair
I slap box with a bear
I can speak from experience, you speak from ignorance
I remove you, have your whole family feelin it
Y'all hate the fact that X-Man got hustle
""Man vs Machine,"" mind vs. muscle
I drop concoctions, you leave me no options
Have your bitch screamin out, ""SOMEBODY STOP HIM!!""
No more Mr. Nice Guy, I'm a tyrant
L.A.'s finest, Open Bar behind us
Don't look hard, it ain't too hard to find us

Too late to apologize kiss my ass

Got to keep your hands up homie protect yo'self
Stop fucking with the West nigga respect yo'self

Boom, the homie came up and was like
""Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face""
Popped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga
Niggas be talkin' all this shit
The only thing I wanna know is, look

See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all

You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G

Sometime men gossip more than women
You do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom
You can't walk in these shoes nigga, you can't fit 'em
I'm bout five seconds away from the ""let's go get him""

Thinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers

Gangsta Gangsta,Napalm,2012.0,"Witness the downfall of man
I wanna kill you for your land, I am the nuclear reactor
Leaking in Japan, I am ill gotten gains I quickly exchange hands
March to the heart beat of the city
You only hear the drums when they attached to the semi
You know what time it is?
Flavor with a thousand checks, it’s like the ice ring surrounds my neck
I never worry about the referee
The gate keepers keep him locked for me
But so is Shaolin, Forever
Always will be underground X to the motherfucker Z
Fought it all with the mighty King T, where my gangstas at?
Hit the park, bailed out the car seen
Blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are
So there will be no warning shots
I’m about to get my city boiling hot and make ‘em pray for rain
And make ‘em say my name, let off more smoke than a coal powered train
This is, Concentration, determination, the very thin line between
Paradise and incarceration

Gangsters, gangsters
Gangsters, stand up and rep what you’re claiming
Police roll around, shake us down, always playing and I…
Gangsters, gangsters
Streets made me into this man, gotta represent who I am

They say right before you day you get the eerie feeling of peace
Then walk into the light
My soul won't be taken without a fight
She says she wanna spend the whole life
But she only got me here for one night
Set your sights, better get it in. Call your best friend
Imma call you wonder-twins
Stop and go like red light traffic
Innovation make it another classic, we made it happen
And big hip hop budgets got cut
Niggas did too much then the feds popped up
And now the game fucked up, ‘cause the lanes clogged up, but the content sucks
I wanna fill up some big rig trucks, time to tour the whole world
Motherfuckers line up
‘cause these tickets gone move like crack
Entire west coast got my back
And y’all niggas saying fuck it with that


Can’t even rely on your own eyes
Everything fake now, toast to the bad guys
That will leave ya hog tied swimming with the fishes
Part machine, part skill, part intuition
I cooked my first ounce in my father’s kitchen
He caught me with a Mac 11, twenty grand and half a chicken
I was shitting on myself and still I let him know
That if he turn me they'd turn around and kill us both
Cos it's a cold world, but I’m a polar bear
Destroy the earth like a solar flare, best beware of us
In God we trust, but everybody else gotta pay cash up front
Call Farrakhan to back me down
I’m on a level now, speak like a minister
Focus study my literature
Clean house, taking out the trash

Look into my eyes tell me what you see (what?)
Victory ecstasy maybe Hennessy
Energy wasted, enemies gettin' laced with

Self disciple Heinakin let the record spin

I kick back like karate
Butter soft burn off and solid black Maserati like

I ain't Jamaican
Find another chicken to jerk
A world of hurt 9 to 5 puttin' in work
Never rest put to the test get put to the death
Never the less only greater than

Full of well-known villains that wanna come home
Never relax ain't no tellin' lay it on wax
Make it bang let Stever sell 'em and dip 'em in chrome
My nigga Bud'da chip off beats like cellular phones
Heir to the throne
Xzibit bring the lead to your dome
Like a 3rd world rebellion squad on your boulevard
Protect they spots with heat
They kids gotta eat to make it big in Cali it depends on who you meet
And who you sleep with
Might find yourself in deep shit
So hit me with your best shot
I'm lookin' forward to it
You shouldn't repeat it if you ain't really goin' through it
How dare you try to check the fluid
Rip the track chillin' on your big plans like Wilsure and Farefax

Bad seeds is planted to grow large and toke us
Whatever is left will be eaten alive by the locusts
Hear me not, believe me later
You can feel the animosity through the Cerwin Vega
A full clip to make this bullshit stop

Cause I can be a dead man if I stand still
Too close for comfort, I'm under the gun
Like a felon going back

Recycled Assassins,40 Days & 40 Nightz,1998.0,"There's no escape from the ones who harassin'
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'
Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'
But season after season they recycle assassins now

He's too advanced for his own good
He didn't get a second chance to see the Glock pointed at his hood
Makin' his way through the rain, he's caught in the game
He felt the pain of a slug to the back of the brain
Nothin's changed in a city flask
Where niggas lurk in black shirts pants and low hats, forever
Until the job is done and no one's left
My man Jeff told me with his very last breath
To watch moms
But they got her with the car bomb
Pop tried to save her second blast got his arm
Niggas play for keeps like casino
Baby's has got fathers just got back from doin' Chino
With nothin' to lose loose screws in the attic
The only skill a nigga knows is how to strip an automatic
And stash the barrel stab a nigga something terrible
Death resume 20 kill in incredible time
No guilt and shame
On the mind stuck a nigga for lookin' didn't know he was blind
So I find
Mankind is a serious threat
To another others kind when there's something to get
In a vet gonna fast jet to the spot to see what they got
Nobody saw shit cause it's not
Cool to break the rule of the code of the streets
Niggas frightened by the visions of the blood on the sheets
And it's deep how blood drys as a mother cries
Open eyes gettin' landed on by flys
There's no disguise for the ones who harassin'
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin' now

There's no escape from the ones who harassin'
The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'
Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'
But season after season they recycle assassins now

I came from a family of one girl and three boys
Fuck playin' with toys our fun was on the block
Watchin' all the cats negotiate the neighborhood stock
My job was to come runnin' whenever cops was comin'
My older brother I figure was the ringleader
Whenever these cats move they all bring heaters
All black and nickel plated (c'mon)
Soon became fascinated bitches cars and kicks
And look at how fast they made it
My younger brother gave less than a fuck he was content
With G.I. Joe and Tonka trucks
But I want butts, livin' first class deluxe
15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks
My older brother was touched
It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane
Crack house for my birthday
The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police
In a rage he lived but he paid the price
Caught with keys 25 to life
Takin' in by the crew time to stand on my own two (c'mon nigga)
But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood
I really can't remember my body doin' good
For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em
Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a
Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast
Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release
Visitors day, my younger brother came down
Put the toys down excited about the first round
He bust I was crushed to finally see
The solution to the problem could of started with me
It's on now

There's no escape from the ones who harassin'

Spit it and didn't waste a minute
So where my niggas at?
What part of the game is that?
I paid my dues now nobody trying to pay me back
And if they did I would probably have as much as Shaq
My life is the movie so listen to the soundtrack
This what its all about
You better stall me out
And feel the aim of the name you niggas calling out

If you feeling how I'm feeling
And you ready and willing
To come to the table
I put it together who doing it better
Come bounce with me (Come on)
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)
Take em out!

And you chosen and proven
So lose the illusion

Come bounce with me (Come on!)
You can smoke a whole ounce with me (Right on!)
Take em out!

Planned it, conceived it
Missed me with the bullshit bitch I don't need it
I cheated, you cheated
We cheated, so beat it
Eat it like a dick bitch you too conceited
I broke it, replaced it
I slammed it, I chased it
Hands in the air if ya love getting wasted baby!
You never seen us before
You better come and get it

I'm busy baby you fucking with it
Is it your place or mind
Don't wanna waste your time
And you can get it how you want it it'll blow ya mind
Its over time
Taking pride in the bump and grind
A hit from behind to leave you with a broken spine
This what its all about
You better stall me out
Its just the game of the name you bitches calling out

Pop it, drink it
Float it, sink it
You plan to stop me then you better rethink it
Drive it, use it
Pimp it, abuse it
The shit motherfuckers do to hip-hop music
I live it, I die it
I'm laughing, I'm crying
Pop two of these bitch, lets start flying
I hear it, I taste it
I touched it, I faced it
Breaking down the bullshit back to the basics
I had to kick in the door
That's how I had to get it
I shitted with lyrics
And getting better for fucking credit
Getting gangsta with it
The best that ever did it
Hit it and quit it my nigga
You shouldn't babysit it
We need more emcees and less wannabes
Three hundred and sixty degrees of reality
That's what its all about
Kill 'em and haul 'em out
Now feel the aim of the name you haters callin' out",https://genius.com/Xzibit-right-on-lyrics

Come and get it, custom-fitted
Hit u where it hurts

I might as well buy a suit right now
Put money on my books downtown to get ready for trial
Look, ya only gotta tell me once
Better wake up and smell these blunts
What's really behind the front
Ain't no parts about me punk
We can thump, don't get too close
Because you might get slump kicked
Front page material, I serial kill shit
Only that real shit, we can scrap or slap clips
My tactics range from Attila the Hun
To Genghis Kahn to the rice fields of Vietnam
Atom bomb my name tag across the sky
Eye for an eye, somebody got to die now


The points that I make be hollow
X a hard act to follow
Disappear in front of your eyes, besides
I switch up rides at least five times
Dangerous minds, caught behind enemy lines
Read the signs, better yet you pick your place
Got a 4-4 eagle to split your face
Nigga you be safe we invade your space
Beat you, beat your team, then beat the case
Poker face, niggas can't read me yo
Green light a mothafucker fa sho, let's go

Crazy Ho,Weapons of Mass Destruction,2004.0,"I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me, cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho

Comin from a cat, that uhh
Believe that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp
He'll probably pimp hisself, that's me, Suga Free
Dig that, yeah, again? Uhh X, man, y'know
If I don't slop her man she feel like I don't love her, youknowhatI'mtalkinabout?
This thing takes all kinds of turns and switches and changes, y'know
It's called the P - Steady!


Woman out the wilderness - bitch!
The homies say you got a wildabeast piece
But she a dimepiece, her mind lost, thrown off course
She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by - bad advice
From a past life, she crazy though
Call my telephone a hundred times in a row
I don't know how to let her go
I'm stuck with this ho - pardon me
But she ain't nuttin but the worst part of me
She even threatened to slice her artery
I gotta watch my God Degree
She tried to voodoo the peas and throw her eyelashes in the recipe
Please, it's more than she's spittin in my lemonade
And R. Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook, like Butch
Yeah, c'mon, spit it


Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin together
And I met her through Aiesha, I shoulda known better
She a pro-fessional charger Laker chaser
The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her (trick)
But she in love with a gangsta
And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her
Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont
Shoulda knew she was a gangsta when she said that it wasn't her man's car
- but now she crazy over me
Tryin to OD, cause she can't be with me
She'll, fuck with different sets just to bring you beef
Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy

How much can one man take?
Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take
So I'm stuck here livin life in fear
Situation so severe
I need to change my ways
Pay more attention to her ho-pefully
Thinkin with my dick every night and day
The bitch won't go away

Girl stop screamin
All in front of my house, tellin everybody you not leavin
And just beat it - you're insane
Crazy and deranged and I don't need you
Look, don't make me repeat it
I'ma say it one time, kick rocks or I'ma call the one-time
I shoulda hollered at your sister (aiy)
We went to the same high school, and plus she finer than you
Hey - baby this one's on you
You know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none too
You dug my man out, your hand's out, askin for help
Hey - go 'head trick, kill yourself, {?}


That means you ain't doin it for free
And that's what I'm talkin 'bout, Suga Free
Up in here with Xzibit y'knamhsayin, West coast big style

Missin’ U,Man vs Machine,2002.0,"(Intro)
This for you (uh) there ain't one day that go by
Where I don't think about you (yeah)
This for my mother, Rest In Peace (uh)
To you and yours (yeah) Ride with me (uh)
Come on
(Verse 1)
I know you watching me, guiding me
I know from up there it's like you watching 'Menace to Society'
Listen you was thirty-two I was only nine
But I've learned so much with so little time
Now I'm surrounded by the best of my kind
We put it all together, couldn't waist your pearls on Swine ma
You taught me better
You can't protect me or expect me to not struggle n fight
Cause see death is a part of life
What I wouldn't give for 1 more day wit you
One last embrace n face to face wit you
Explain everything that made me what I am a grown man
From the ground up with my own hands
Will I forget you? Neva
Down right angry sometimes that we ain't here together
You can feel your roots and see how strong we are
Who would've thought we could get this far, damn I miss you
(Chorus: Andre Wilson)
Even though I know it's been tough
I can't stress enough no matter what - mama I love you
You've always been there by my side
You've taught the wrong from the right - mama I love you
(Verse 2)
Yesterday was you fifty-ninth birthday
Time flew missing you in the worst way
I still feel the same pain since the first day
You left through death on God's request
I can't complain through the year's mama I've been stressed
Through them bullets and the bad times I've been blessed
For the times that I fail but I tried my best
Able to do for my loved one's, real success
Your the source of my strength I was blessed with your gifts
Your insights, your wisdom, your penmanship
Fun n games, I'm doing thangs, I know you wouldn't agree with
What I drink, what I smoke, who I be with
You made sure I got some love when there wasn't none
Opened up my heart showed the world where I'm coming from
Your little grandson is just like your little boy
Mama what you built here no man can ever destroy, your bundle of joy
I've been through so much
I lose touch and sometimes I feel that life sucks
My women try to get close I push here away
She wanna talk I just sit there with nothing to say
Feel me its all the pain I contain on the inside
You in the right place but left me at the wrong time
Use to cook, clean, and sing me to sleep
Now I only go to bed with my heat, damn I miss you
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
The school of hard knocks where I learned life's lessons
With not enough answers and too many questions
When you had me you gave birth to a soldier
Now I'm much older now the world much colder
Our lives in the hands of politicians that don't care
We ponds in the game biological warfare
The family's so spread out n disconnected
Trying to hold things together put my soul on records
It's hard; you know your daughter had a baby too
A beautiful baby girl just another little piece of you
Another branch we can add to the family tree
Responsibility bringing out the man in me
You ain't a man if your not taking care of home
Raise and protect my own, until they full-grown
No matter how much these streets try to change me
I'm never 'gon forget how you raised me
I Love You, Forever

Yeah, all the mothers, all the daughters, yeah, come on

I Came To Kill,Napalm,2012.0,"This is the long drop method, supposed to be more humane
Measure your height and your weight to break your neck when you hang
Sometimes they use a short drop or they use a crane
Either way the victim dies in agonizing pain
But if the calculations incorrect when the rope's set
The rope will rip the head right off a motherfuckers neck
My appointment at the gallows x emerging from the shadows
With a vendetta better who wanna battle
Man you gon' get whipped and flogged
Shackled to an A-frame
Beaten full force until you can't repeat your own name
Until you smell the smell of burning flesh (yes)
Keep you alive until you pray for death (yes)
Drawn and quartered, disemboweled till there's nothing left
Saudi Arabia amputation for petty death
Li chin translated this the leader in death
A rubber tire filled with gas around your arms and chest
Set you on fire turn your body to a melted mess
Ask the AT about that south African necklace
Go ahead and pick your poison, get what's coming to you
Call me the brazen bull, I came to fucking kill you

???? must I come through merciless
Bequeath me with that bullshit you utter
Uncut raw, what, and we ride through
And always remember that death will come on swift wings
Anyone who're uncontested now, have we now ?????
I came to kill

Hands behind your back shackled and I forced you to kneel
Shoot you in the back of the head, send your family the bill
For what the bullets cost, I'm on my China shit
Eye for an Eye waterboard you like my government
Impaled and left at the front gates
You should hear the sound a broken arm rib and leg makes
When being pulled apart, call that the breaking wheel",https://genius.com/Xzibit-i-came-to-kill-lyrics

Soon be comin the judgement day
(Ahh, soon there be comin the judgement day)

Yes, uhh, breathe with me
C'mon.. listen, yo
I know you're fed up, feel like you can't get up
Have faith, stay strong, keep your head up
Yo, it only gets worse; we in a world
Where your status and your bank account determine your worth
There's no time to rehearse, the clock been tickin
Cause we all started dyin at birth, I speak the truth and it hurts
It felt like I was dyin of thirst
'til I was blessed with my voice, I move mountains with verse
The worst thing you ever seen in your life, ""The Passion of Christ""
Pregnant chicks buyin rock, hittin the pipe
It ain't like I ain't tried to tell ya; misery love company
Keepin the wrong company brings failure
Cause people use people like paraphenalia
With a scam, with a scheme, with a dream to sell ya
But I ain't got nothin but love for all my soldiers and thugs
To all of my women, we gotta keep livin, c'mon

You can turn your back and then walk away
(Ohh, don't turn your back and then walk away y'all)
Soon be comin the judgement day
(Soon there be comin judgement day)

Yeah! C'mon
Mr. X to the Z had to raise the stakes
Had to touch my people like T.D. Jakes
On the ground like a nigga flippin crumbs to cake
I won't stop like an eighteen wheeler with no brakes
Bein dipped in her-on so each CD's weight
Niggas be fake, they speak what they can't create (create)
You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame
One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff
I was only 15, tryin to pass that rock
Never got caught, just sat down, collected my thoughts
This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat
I'm just another nigga sellin some coke, y'know?
Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote
My callin for ballin wasn't pedalin dope
It was oversea convoys, bangin out cuts
No police or government agency lockin me up, so what?

You can turn your back and then walk away
(You can turn your back and then walk away)
Soon be comin the judgement day
(SOOOOON there'll be a-comin a judgement day)

C'mon..
What do you believe in? I believe in karma
And that fo'-five to drop that drama
Can't wait for the time when I meet my maker
Picture everlasting life in Jamaica, time to wake up
Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words
Your words become actions when the bullshit happens
Keep laughin, that's when the gauge start clackin
Feel the buckshots smackin have your body mismatchin
Yo, I feel the devil tryin to force my hand
Steady bringin out the soldier in a peaceful man
See I was born to be all that I can, without a Uncle named Sam
As you can see we just a part of his plan
Cause first there was a war on blacks
And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in Iraq, c'mon
I never give up, I only give back
I ain't preachin I'm just statin the facts
So let the choir SING!

We gettin' drunk, smokin' herb and the third dyke you roll
Non-stop cash flow, 20,000 dollars and the rest cuttin' yayo
We had the rocks, my nigga late to pick it up
Get him on the phone, hurry up 'cause I ain't tryin' to get stuck
So what the fuck is the hold up?

Reminds me I gotta shake the spot
I got bitches in the hotel room ready for me to bang cob weight (*knock*)
Yo, who is that man?

Yeah, that's when I shoulda got the heater
But I was too busy in the kitchen countin' money and takin' shots of tequila
Started countin' out twelve when it hit me
If you was Rocksteady, you woulda came when the C-Note's rang
Before I could yell out to lock the front of my small dick (""Ayy, ayy"")
Niggas rushed in the front door with the gauge, ready, duck (""Get yo' ass down"")
Bad enough I'm caught up in it, jacked
But worse than that, I'm caught in the kitchen without the strap

Yeah, woulda killed Terminators
Only D between us is a stove and a refrigerator (yeah)
Came in and put the gauge to my chest
Took the money off the table and said (""Yo, where's the rest of it, nigga?"")
You gotta love it, came straight to the moneyman
20,000 cash, neatly stacked, wrapped in rubber bands
Snatched the whole shit and broke out
I ran to the living room and got the heat from under the couch
Smashed out into the middle of the street started blastin' (""Alright, nigga"")
Dumpin' at the getaway cars but they was mashin'
I thought I heard the homies just in time for the action
Police hit the corner with they reds and white's flashin'
These niggas rolled off with at least a cool fifty
Yeah, I'm in handcuffs on the ground and mad 'cause the K-9 bit me
Shipped me off downtown for the bookin'
Threw my herb sack when the cops wasn't lookin'
Fingerprints, hold the tape, hear come detectors
One at the door, another one askin' questions
Stupid shit like, ""Who was I shootin' at?
Was it gang related and where do they kick it at?""
But I didn't say shit
I can tell from all the people involved it was an inside job
But I'm the wrong nigga to rob, I'll hunt you down
Fuck the money, I'll take you off and accept the loss
Set bail at fifteen G's, no sweat
Got cars slippin' tonight, and almost got wet
Homies come to set bail see, but that's all right
Since I'm already here I'ma spend the night

Hey, hey I need to use the phone again
*Car horns*
Ay, ay man
Since when did you start takin shoestrings and shit?
Man, ahh
Do I look like I wanna kill?

'Was it somethin' i did? was it my three kids?
You don't love me no more, was it the wave or the wig?'
I'm tryna be nice, so i'm sittin' there thinkin'
But i had to tell the bitch 'baby your breath be stinkin' (ha ha)
Niggas, spendin' they last, tryna hustle for ass
You bought a Cadillac truck, but you can't buy gas
Insurance is a bitch, i hope you don't crash
But when you do, let me buy them rims and slap 'em on my jag
When it come to fasion, don't make me start flashin'
Break a bitch off, and have that whole tire slashin'
I'm leather, you're leather, together we be clashin'
Quik! hit 'em with the chorus, homie start bashin'!

25 To Life,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Wyclef talking:
Yo to my people doing time, Xzibit, Juvenile, y'all need to
Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on
Bring the heat

Look, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain
Stuck with a thousand street hustlers
Down on they luck
Repeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'
And for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'
But I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense
If I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground
Fox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down
By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual
Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General
Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal
Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal
I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys
I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne
See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth
Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside
(Wyclef)

You got me fucked up I'm innocent
Look I ain't do this shit you don't want to hear my side
But you believin' that bitch
You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'
'cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go
Where my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya
Y'all go tell that to my mother & my father
But they gon' cus y'all so don't you even bother
You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'
'cause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks
Look the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball
This is my third felony plus my third strike
Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life
QU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I she'd light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'
Indy's throwin' Tyson back in another year
Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight
'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts
And turn killers into girl scouts works of art
Picasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier

Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short
Still the thought of murderer true to the sport
I bang with the best niggas them career criminals
Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out
Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now
Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial
New kicks new trial I don't give a fuck
I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts
Ready to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die
But what powered your honor to hit me with 25
I know that real recognize every hustle
And die with these niggas in the struggle
Ya feel me
Reptile
Oh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted
Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene
Huntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween
Mashed down in the fatigues servin' the fiends
Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve
In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess
Ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets
No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts
Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug
You 'bout to die thug!
Call the President I'm blowin' up ya residence
Spill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence
Protestors outside screamin' free Gotti
Guard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty

Don’t Let the Money Make You,40 Days & 40 Nightz,1998.0," I want to ask you, what is more important to you guys?
All the money that you guys are talkin' about?
Or the artform? Or, what is more important? The Lyrics?
Or the leather sized stuff?
 I think, what we tryin' to do is device a way that the
Artform and the money is like on a equal level
You know what I mean, that, that like he said, is a fine
Line where gotta pleas the crowd or pleas the artists
That are listenin' to you. And pleas the real hip-hop
Underground people that, that, that is looking for that
You know, that real shit. It's only a certain way that
That you can go up and doin' it

Xzibit keep it on deck
Live, vinyl, CD or cassette
Whatever you select
I keep you bouncin' like a bad cheque
See I should have a trigger tattooed on my neck
To represent the heat that I repeat
Now you can take the highs out of the beat
But never take the rucked out of the rhyme
Or tribalize, look into the eyes of the emotional
Your whole style is promotional
A dead giveaway to me is just another business day
Xzibit here to stay
My life, a tribute to the A.K
You wanna play
A situation only one man can walk away from
The same way he came
When I spit flame, it spits flames like your middlename
So why do I say fuck the fame
Because it come and go
The industry's a pet without refused to be that gigolo
I put the dope in, got fo's and tatoos
Niggas make ya money
But let the money make you

We make, make money, money
Take's money to survive
The meanin' of life with statted chips is stay alive
Cause it's all about the C-notes
Gonna be fuckin' when you're rollin' this too
Don't let the money make you

It's Soopafly
Comin' with that gangsta shit
That shit that only gangstas be gettin' gangsta with
The pimps, hustlers and the players know the rank I get
Never have to get no money from the bank, I get shit
I Stomp down your whole compound
Takin' all the shots
Device from the few I'm rise
Let the others drop
I elevate
Who drop when a dime never got me straight
I'm still goin' for broke
I push you to the stroke
And one man loc and say high
Smokin' to keep an open, mind
Focus on military time provokin'
The G in me, nigga
(?) when he tried to step the Soopafly
AZ you are shit
Now gettin' down with the Pound
Now who can shake it till it break ground
Many motherfuckers are greedy
There's only one thing needed like E.D.I, Amin / I mean business
When it comes to the cash, I'm movin' quick
(Xzibit: Any other nigga eat a dick)
Fuck type shit
Make ya step back
Soopafly, hit like crack
Life is a jet
Maintainin' the top figures deliver
The raw, rugged likwidation that be runnin' the river
Now, whether if a nigga step up
Be prepared to kick your rap up
Try to die in line for you cheque, huh nigga


So when I die
Bury me upside-down
So the whole world can kiss my ass
Live fast
Sippin' from my bottomless glass of Hennessy, straight
So I catch you (?)
Xzibit comin' down like a saint
So prepare for the judgement day
Be careful what the fuck you say
Rhyme these parts
Amadeus and Mozart
The love for the arts and crash
Paragraphs to bust niggas in half
That's what I fuck with
(?) time to get my duck sit
Miss me if you try to make a buck with
I mean a quick buck, only got bad luck
Black cash every black trash
Never relax, never get attached to anything
That's not gonna hand so life
I come back like Christ
Pacific natural ice
With Sharif makin' sure R&B, was well done
Might live by the gun
But keep livin' through my livin' son

Bitch Please,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You ain't trying to hot box with me, I swing hard liquor
Going down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backing down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk driving, trying to stack my loot
While other rappers getting ""Treated Like a Prostitute""
So check the SoundScan
All I wanna be was a G, ha!
My whole life, nigga please, ha!
Breaking off these motherfuckin keys, ha!
Let's get these motherfuckin G's, ha!
Nigga you don't wanna fuck with this
Oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezee bay-bay
You jocking my style? ""You so cra-zy""
Dre say, ain't ""No Limit"" to this

Look here bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it ""Doggystyle""
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental

For this money, chronic, clothes and weed

Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dough (f'real)
Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks
Oh, you like setting niggas up and getting them loc's?
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (well hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg I'm movin!
Ain't nothing to it but to get to groovin
You've been waiting on a nigga like me
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (bang BANG!)
I'm trying to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang
I get the money everywhere that I go
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho

Black & Brown,Full Circle,2006.0,"Wassup?
We need to talk
Let me light my backport
That’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Yo, I love Los Angeles, you can hear it in my music
Plus I got the scars to prove it
And man.. you don’t understand what I understand
I’m feelin like a piece to a bigger plan
‘Cause all I’m sayin is the God honest truth of it all, we fightin the wrong enemy
That’s why I’m gettin invovled, it’s just like the end of that movie “Saw""
When them two chained up guys met with their demise
And the mastermind was layin there the whole time
Remember that? That’s why we have to sit down
And speak about the black and the brown
Now I didn’t come here to point no fingers
I know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations
Shit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations
And everybody lose.. from the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it’s even the high schools
'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News
When the students squared off and one kid wouldn’t choose sides
Hit with a hammer and the kid died and now it’s a full blown riot
Tck, that’s when the fists start flyin
These kids ain’t learnin shit about math and science
Man..
Tension is so thick, some are comin around
I don’t wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now.. that’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Eighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic
They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit.. that’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Yo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day
He came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey
And he don’t really fuck with nobody outside of the set
It’s tatted big on his neck
Y'know? So over the years, built respect and trust
Some black and brown issues we both discussed
He said, “Homes, it’s been goin down too long
I gotta bang on them fools and it don’t feel wrong""
""They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks
So word came down, we gotta handle that shit""
""Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts
Can I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin""
At first, I remind him of what vengeance do
What vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to
He wasn’t tryna hear that shit
He just turned up the volume, bangin 50 Cent
Tension is so thick, some are comin around
I don’t wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now.. that’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Eighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic
They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit.. that’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
I got soldiers from both sides who really don’t care
Who identify themselves by the colors they wear
The homey came through to put one in the air
I can tell somethin was wrong the way he sat in his chair
He said, “X, man I’m just gettin out
From doin eighty eight months, tryna figure things out""
He told me in the pen you get down to get done
‘Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one
He showed me the scar on his gut and his neck
They got him good, said he damn near bled to death
The hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes
When he described what it feels like to almost die
All I could do was just sit back and listen
'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions
I got hit with a bottle but I’m not dead
I said, ""Think with your heart homey, not your head""
I said..
Tension is so thick, some are comin around
I don’t wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now.. that’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Eighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic
They tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet
Dammit.. that’s why we need to sit down
And talk about the black and the brown
Oooooh you must defend yourself (Yeah!)
If you don’t, then no one else (Nobody!)
Your homies got to ride (Let’s go!)
You’re fighting for your life (Yeah!)
They want both of us dead
You ain’t heard a word I said
You’re fighting for your life (Come on)
Your homies got to ride
Tension is so thick, some are comin around
I don’t wanna see no more of us up under the ground
So now.. that’s why we need to sit down

I see you got some kids, that you ain't never with
Your baby father put hands on you, some crazy shit
So he gon' pay for that, fuck with niggas who rap
Most of that quality time is spent on your back
Now before I devote the rest of my life
Can you at least show a nigga you can boil some rice
(ha ha ha) Is that too much to ask, am I movin too fast
Do you have anything to offer me besides some ass
You think you high class, the upper echelon
But spend all your rent money in the hair salon
I'm 'sposed to help you out, but it just made me think
You ain't ready for the world, you ain't ready for me


Damn baby I see they drivin you crazy
Because your body's amazing I know you want it to phase me
But hey - I seen a lot of girls, messed up a lot of curls
You ain't gon' keep me with sex when only sex occurs
Want you to think ahead, not just give me head
Want you to make a household baby, not just a bed
I know the scene is what you seem to see
Where you needin to be, but believe you me
Baby girl they just gon' use you up, fuck you and bruise you up
They ain't got no family values they ain't gon' choose you up
We disrespect ourselves, we think we livin well

Now what am I doin' here?

And that's kinda weird to me
I guess this ol' fuck session ain't what it appear to be
Because the concierge has just brought the bill to me
I go 200 miles per hour on a street bike
And 9-0 beats per minute on a sweet mic
Whenever I get with bitches I lose a little somethin'
Sperm by the zones, we keep it hot and goin'
Xzibit we got it flowin', don't even approach us, you only get roaches
How you gon' smoke with us nigga when you can't even focus

I pick locks made by NFL, NBA, NHL, fuck all day

And all in ya mouth, the bedroom, kitchen and couch
You should thank all of the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin' got me fuckin' you right
I insist that we fuckin' on videotape
Just in case a bitch lose face and try and call rape
If you know somethin' that might excite up our late night
Got an open invite to lay us a pipe
Make ya head feel like your wet, warm and tight
I'll go from all night till the sun turn bright
Two wrongs don't make it right bitch, no need to cheat
(Pussy just a piece of meat, another means to eat)
Big Tray D told me that, as a matter of fact
You only tell me that you love me when you're flat on your back
You wanna leave me now bitch, my fuckin' feelings is hurt
Why am I the only one that's tryna make this work
You should thank of all the bitches that I have in my life
All the experience I'm gettin' got me fuckin' you right
Never took time to see it and plus
All you thinkin' 'bout is yourself, I'm thinkin' for us
You love the way I beat it down when I come in the house
And all in ya mouth, the bedroom, kitchen and couch

Ram Part Division,Full Circle,2006.0,"I'm the police, I'm the police
I'm the police, I'm the police

I love my fucking job, and I don't want to stop
Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be a cop
You know protect and serve, a couple traffic stops
I make a bust, and take a lil' something out the top
A thin blue line, we run these streets
You bang on them, but never bang on me
I cell search, stepping on pillows and sheets
I'm the police, treat a nigga just like fresh meat
I got a short wick, on some New York shit
Take you to the precinct and fuck you with a broomstick
I patrol your hood, put you on my hood
Leave you in the wrong hood, got it understood
PC 647b, that's a prostitute, plus she kind of cute
She don't want to go to jail, well bitch I'll tell you what
Get on your muthafuckin' knees, suck my partner up

I'm the police, I'm the police
I'm the police, I'm the police

You know a couple of muthafuckas was giving us grief
Pulled a couple strings, dodge the media beef
Ever since them niggas in black said ""Fuck the police""
I been grinding on the back of my teeth, loading my piece
Waiting for some, get back like it or not
We investigated the shots, that killed Biggie and Pac
Ever wonder why nobody ever figured it out
Cause we the ones that got to figure it out
I shout freeze at the top of my lungs
I'm the cream of the crop
You don't stop you get popped by my warning shots
And if you try to come back, with a civil suit
I sit back and watch my system take a shit on you

Order in the court, Order in the court
That muthafucka shot me, case dismissed
Ha Ha Ha Ha, police
I'm the police

You see this fuckin' badge, you see these fuckin' lights
I'm in your neighborhood rolling on you every night
You faggots run and duck, look at you scared as fuck
You see me coming in your mirror niggas straighten up
Turn that hat around, I'm here to take you down
Hey partner look at these weapons and this coke I found
I'm going to let it slide, show you who you can trust
And if you want to keep selling, nigga you sell for us
Make you a 1030, I'll get you hands dirty
Murder for hire, professional liar
I plan to make police chief and then retire
I remember when you set your own hood on fire
I reinforce the freeways, to bring the tanks
So the next time y'all trip, fuck bloods and crips
Cause we the biggest gang in L.A
Ramp Part, fuck with us, get blown away

Forth down and one to go
Run your own franchise boilin' with Team Ecko
I'm here for one thing to smash the other team
Breaking you down, everything you pass is out of bounds and incomplete
Ecko unlimited athletes making you stumble and fumble
Your offense in deep trouble

Up in the stands pushin' off Superbowl plans
You will contact EA Sports you realize the facts (Yeah)

You can be bullish and rollick
Yo ass will still get demolished
Polished, and keeping' a mulish
My niggas eat like piranhas
We party stupid, retarded
Most niggas jaded and guarded
Cause they not popular product
This ain't no Gucci or Prada
This is a topless Impala
North Hollywood body armor
For when they come with the drama
(For when they come with the drama.)
So I continue the saga
Move out the path of the lava
Move in position and conquer
You have created a monster
Wake up and call out the culprit
I never weaken or soften
Might catch me weezin' and coughin'
Because I blaze very often
I need to knock this shit off of shit
I got problems my nigga
And they get bigger and bigger
You can not solve, what a thriller
This is a pivotal moment
This is my time of atoning
This is my world and I own it
So come and take if you want it
Please God forgive me for sinnin'
Winnin', and makin' a killin'
Witness revenge of the villains
Sexual healin' from women
I bust a nut to their ceilin'
I crash a plain in their buildin'
But now I'm married with children
Katal and balance the millions
I'm in another direction
Life bless is taking it's blessin's
You need to hear my confession
Forever walk with a weapon
I live and die like a soldier

C'mon let's take this shit over

Make patches and master my master piece
Niggas have the audacity
Trynna adapt to capacities
Of your highness, your majesty
What the fuck is you asking me?
With my accurate accuracy
Immaculate faculties
With a nation in back of me
I see promising situations evolve into tragedies
I just hustle and hustle because it comes to me naturally
I'm a buffalo soldier clappin' you back to Jehovah
C'mon let's take this shit over
(C'mon let's take this shit over.)
I'm a super nova eclipse
On your current events
This ain't no novelty spittin' hotter than barbeque bits
Lorena Bobbit, you ditched!
Trigger's still good in my grip
You showin' off for the cameras while I just stick to the script

I'm a walkin time bomb, don't tick me off
Crucified to die, nailed to the cross
Natural transition, foot soldier to boss
The A.K. ricochet put blood in your cough

Take a muh'fucker's life somebody comin for yours
It's the get-back gangstas don't believe in karma
Only the strength of the dollar and the body armor

Murder rap never attached, got too many snaps
It's more than raps, it's actual facts
Welcome back to the West, left side of your map
Been attacked from all sides, it's time for the payback
Lay back, wait for the right time to spray that
Spray that motherfucker, down to the last clip
Last clip you save for the cop on some waive shit

Straight to apocalypse is where I'm takin the art
Givin niggas battle scars, ALWAYS makin my mark
You fakin the part of gangster, til niggas break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? Thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like Frankie Beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggas be gassed like Cipher Sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy
 One, two, three, four
 Why the fuck can't MC's MC no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
 One, two, three, four
 Takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""Gimme Some Mo'"" like Busta Bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

I'm i-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with God
Rah Digga, First Lady of the Flipmode Squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggas you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime

The American dream
Sounds like the beginnin of the endin
Of the millenium when you in a storm's lightning
Inner city kid with a pipe dream
Shut down in the blink of an eye
Handcuffed in the back of a cop car
On the block where his best friend just died
Everything they showed and they know is lies
Everything we had before it was ours
Look real deep in the eyes of 'em
Look real deep in the minds of the blind and
Put my time in the rhyme and
Do you by the signs of the time kid
Whenever I spit that, line for line shit quick, quick
E'rybody calm down just for a bit
Yo, livin in the land of the dark
Livin in the land of the lost
30,000 feet up 'til we landed
Goin city to city to rock, watch all the fans put they hands up, up
This is that realer, iller, killer
Down for a nigga, I'm standin (yeah!)
Somethin that's iller, iller, nigga (yeah)
Somethin that the people are demandin

Check the background, your rap's not tight
We don't fight, we push lead through the pipe
Came like a thief in the night
I lean with the left then I follow right behind with the right
California term' on sight
Then I take it back to the D, ""Whatupdoe?""
Cut up flow the same way I cut up blow
Shut up hoe, abducted, U.F.O
Walk in a war zone, U.S.O
I'm at an all-time new plateau, lockin a round let it go
Anybody get bodied you better know
Can't do anything about it but get low
On the real, before you get the Maybach and the self-made tags
Get your own lane, fuck tryin to bring the game back
Slap you out them skinny ass jeans with a back slap
Better make change, you them niggas get they chain snatched

Only the best of the best around me
Big coupe, niggas know about me
Styrofoam cup with promethazine
Got my body on lean, tell 'em ""Slow it down please""
Never play with a nigga
Drive by, never wave at a nigga
G-5, real plane/plain on a nigga
I'ma pray for you niggas and we throwin it like it's free

Lobster perception, stand at ease with attention
Did I really even have to mention?
Now me, X, Black on a pursuit of perfection
Formulate a plot, man fuck your conception
Brand new nigga with a flow that's divine
All they ever did was write line after line
Killin time after time and I'm not in my prime
So instead of watchin the throne man the glory is mine
Where do we go when we conquered it all?
How do we feel when there's nothin at all?
Why do we walk when we started to crawl?
But like King James I was destined to ball
Like what up, what up, we got one, hot one
Spit lyrical homicide with a shotgun
Click clack boom, praise God that we lost son
Told these muh'fuckers not to mess with the wrong one
Songs don't wait, welcome to the new edition
Hand-to-hand, eliminate the competition
Westside to the D, it's a coalition
That we grind so hard that we had to give the
Rags to the riches, keys to the business
What is this? Just a young nigga with ambition
Knock your head off, protect my position
Man down, man on a mission, listen

Only the best of the best around me
Big coupe, niggas know about me
Styrofoam cup with promethazine
Got my body on lean, tell 'em ""Slow it down please""
Never play with a nigga
Drive by, never wave at a nigga
G-5, real plane/plain on a nigga
I'ma pray for you niggas and we throwin it like it's free",https://genius.com/Xzibit-throw-it-like-its-free-lyrics
What You Can’t C,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let me roll somethin' witcha
Let me smoke somethin' witcha
Let me light this up
Let me blow somethin' withca

Mr X to the Z dog, I had to do it
Locked the game down like Martha Stewart
Like a big bodied Mercedes, get into it
This ain't no luck of the draw, I'm supposed to do it
They say we're in the last days so I stay with the bottle
And stay swingin' for the fifths like its no tomorrow
Make a nigga trade hard like I'm custom model
Each one, teach one, we gonna lead, so follow
Niggas soft like avocado, trying to hold bravado
My tips be hollow, some real hard shit to swallow
It's the S.A.S express don't get caught on the tracks
We got no brakes we just break backs
We came in broke, now we got to leave with the whole stack
Get slapped get smoked like a dope sack
Cannabis and cheeba on the block with a heater
Like if I can't sell mine, y'all can't neither

You can read me in the magazines
Or watch me on the TV screen
If you ever tryin' to take for me
That's gon' be the last day you breath
Nobody here rides for free
You fuckin' with a real O.G
I stick 'n move like a young Ali
You can't hit what you can't see.... (me, me)

Let me roll somethin' witcha
Let me smoke somethin' witcha
Let me light this up
Let me blow somethin' withca

To all my niggas drinkin' Cool-O
Gettin' bent in prison
Watchin' the game, they can't stop us from livin'
I was givin' the direction but I never took it
The path was crooked and cracked so I learned to cook it
It's the black ?, the world on his back
Animal instinct, adjust to my habitat
Any situation, react
You get manhandled and slapped down, mean not fuckin' around
I think big like the heart that rests in my chest
Fuck punk motherfuckers that pray for my death
Niggas want me to show love, but ain't none left
Won't speak no names, I won't waste my breath
Got too much stamina, too much energy
Strengthen capabilities to crush my enemies
And that feelin' brings me peace and tranquility
Real estate, power, sports cars in Italy

You can read me in the magazines
Or watch me on the TV screen
If you ever tryin' to take for me
That's gon' be the last day you breath
Nobody here rides for free
You fuckin' with a real O.G
I stick 'n move like a young Ali
You can't hit what you can't see...(me, me)

Let me roll somethin' witcha
Let me smoke somethin' witcha
Let me light this up
Let me blow somethin' withca

Another nigga like Xzibit just can't be found
I eliminate dead weight slowin' me down
Don't know how to back down only hold my ground
Check the resume
They just cock it and spray
Ya'll niggas just sloppy and gay, get hit with a K
Stand trial for murder and lock me away
Throwin' bows like Anthony Pillar
For my foes, bullet hoes through ya clothes and that fake Chinchilla
For all my niggas in the hustle, celebrate ya life
Fucking Bush administration tryin' to take your life
X man exchange the data, hate the hater
Hit the earth so hard leaving cracks and craters
Niggas wanna spend money on hats and gaters
Hoes in Vegas they gotta have chrome and dames
But don't wanna do a third of the work
I built an empire from dirt
I put you in a world of hurt...fucker!!!

You can read me in the magazines
Or watch me on the TV screen
If you ever tryin' to take for me
That's gon' be the last day you breath
Nobody here rides for free
You fuckin' with a real O.G

Game Face,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I don't fuck around I'll break you down in the hours of H
All these L.A. Times motherfuckers keepin the pace
No need to pull strings things still get done
To have you yellin at the top of yo lungs
So Xzibit never speak wit a false tounge
Slid off like a handgun
Tryin to build an empire to pass to my grandson
I never like to talk business over the phone
So either have love for the game or leave it alone
Plus action speak louder than words
And pussy move faster than birds
So I gotta keep a gameface
On the street you slip, and you might catch a hot one
Xzibit stay low and kick back like a shotgun
I keep it bangin to the end of the line
When a rapper think his faggot style is fuckin with mine, it's divine
Cuz my family is harder than bricks
Anything to keep it movin cuz it's harder to hit

(Ras Kass)
Only right I fuck wit  you when you fuckin' wit mine
Keep it movin to the end of the line
And action speak louder than words
And pussy move faster than birds
Gotta keep a gameface

Only right I fuck wit  you when you fuckin' wit mine
Keep it movin to the end of the line
And action speak louder than words
And pussy move faster than birds
Gotta keep a gameface

Men must be either pampered or crushed
To regulate, relegate, delegate power, nigga touch something
Trust no one and die dumping
Drained ya battery you barely talking like Teddy Ruxpin
See that's wassup, nigga I don't give a fuck
Say some shit so nasty, it'll make Little Kim blush
As if, a 98 bentley didn't tempt me
To lay bullshit over this MP
But consequently my conscience wouldn't permit me
I'm one-third black man, one-third Jackie Chan
One-third sand, shiftin across the surface of the land
Golden State Warrior let my nuts hang like niggas in nooses
While you givin groupies all your loochie
I'm known for fucking hoochies in suzukis
And known for slippin bourgeois bitches roofies
Loved and feared, severe yet loved
The full time titan fighting three million over night thugs
So keep your, hand out your rectum cause you can't stop shit
Don't rock shit, studio hustlers
Claimin' they got more keys than a locksmith
What part of the game is this
Bonus Round, give me the mic, the money
The pussy in that order, the more, the over-populated
Get fucked and orally copulated
And all you chumps on some you owe me an apology shit
Can suck yo apology out my dick


(Ras Kass)
This is for the black niggas, the yak sippers
The part time strippers,slash full time student,and fifty buck slippers
I got athletes feet,we run these contrete streets
Sporting cleats, ain't nothing sweet
(Xzibit)
I'm making rappers get they shit together
Still smokin, still drinkin, still maintain clear thinkin
Everyday is the weekend, mashin thru in a lincoln
And style so sick, the whole car start stinking",https://genius.com/Xzibit-game-face-lyrics

First taste of the future, we all hands on
Amputating Satan's last legs to stand on
Head strong re-match, dollar for dollar, bullet for bullet

Dont shoot it, mind polluted, deeply rooted

Bit more than you can chew, handle it, street's scandalous
Dynasty met, no need to pretend, mix liquor, top shelf nigga
With the marvelous blend
Oh you think you the chief now? You know how we get down
You claim to spit rounds but are you hittin shit clown?
Your aim is all off, I make your crew hit ground
Jump in your six nigga, its time to skirt off now

Play hard now? My niggas gonna shut it all down
You cheap like First Down got beef like ground round

See I'm the motherfuckin man layin over Japan
Computer hack through your laptop
Then leave your whole SoundScanned (what the fuck?!?)
And watch you panick like the bitch you are
I'm the mechanic with a pipe bomb that fits your car
Ka-boom, now I assume your homies wanna retalliate
Set em straight with a thirty-eight, the wrong cat to violate
So watch Xzibit and Shabaam start to dilate
Anihilate competition, some niggas got hard heads
And just don't listen, they the ones you find missin
Better get on the right team and play your position
See I'm lost, scandalous, finest
Blew your back out because your spineless
I'm never makin music for the mindless
Cause I'm hard to the core, and I'll never go soft
Just consider us the hitmen thats knockin you off

Yeah, yeah, See I'm ready to raise a ruckus
Try to elevate you motherfuckers to the places where the law can't touch us
Walk off on your own or with the aid of crutches
Anyway you want it to happen I'm ready for action
You get shot up under my soles, call it Fatal Attraction
Beat you niggas till you get it right, like Joe Jackson
Listen, we here to give the hardcore what they lookin for
At the same time pimp the game like a fucking whore

In this game here, we got swift handles
Dismantle your chalkboard strategy, check the replay
Here you gets no shine we dimmin your light
Make your heart pump *echoes* when my squad's in sight

Reaching but can't hit it

The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol
My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fuckin shots I called
My niggas gotta ball, never settle for less
Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts
Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll somethin
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole somethin

Yo these style I kick should be called?? Rap
Drawin the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet (shhhhh)
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L. A
With connectin flights to rip it elsewhere

Drinkin up Black & Tan in the back of a van
I learned as a young man - long trip, piss in a can
Gettin a house for two grand, now you got your own land
Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan
Ro-Gram is rare earth, swingin Black Tarzan
You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand
Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand
And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty)
Dirty like Uncle Red; aiyyo, (??) (??)
Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo
Dirt you dishin out, chef tellin it all
Face down in the dirt, doin my dirty work
Expert, tryin to regulate my network
Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it
If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it
Chorus with minor variations

And I've been known to get it on, past the break of the dawn
Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave ""Potholes in Yo' Lawn""
(C'mon!) You makin diss songs? Spit that rhyme my way
I can shut y'all niggas down like the Y-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggas coincide
(""Right-right-right.."") The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album goin classic

This is for the dj, bring it back one time
I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme
I'm - old school like my dad is
So add this, to your collect', Plug Won - who the baddest?

Aiyyo we theme park status, upstage these niggas like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blamin they legs, while I'm claimin these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

Yeah - we flat out classic, seperate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is makin sure that Hollywood burn
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back
De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that
And what you know about us droppin ya
And leavin you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?
Chorus with minor variations

Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

You got the right to shut the fuck up! {*laughing*}",https://genius.com/Xzibit-my-writes-lyrics

Don't sweat the technique 'cause I was put on the street
To delete the weak minded, if you've got beef then grind it

But I don't fuck with that shit
Your only dope was your last hit
Constantly lit up from the place where we hit 'em
In the wrong hair dresser have you leavin' in an ambulance stretcher
Xzibit heard a thousand strikes
I give a fuck about five mics and kerosene lights
All I need is my royalty checks my ice cold becks
So bitch, you dig ruff sex with funk master Flex

Aw yeah!
Right about now it's time to get busy
Huh, straight out the box, nonstop
Kurupt the Kingpin, Xzibit, Crooked I
(Wait a minute, um)
Crooked I:
This is the art of, manslaughter
When I'm rockin' I'm more shockin' than droppin' a boom box in bath water
You entered the wrong scuffle
You catchin' a chrome buckle
I uppercut niggas hard enough to break my own knuckles
Deliver the sick verbals
My shotty spit a round, before you hit the ground
Your body spin around, in six circles
Diminishin' infamous menaces
I'm waitin' to get dicced, if not, I'm a start finishin' innocents
Freezin g's in your legion
Freakin' ancient techniques when I'm speakin' phoenician
It's all about Crooked
These bitches shout Crooked
I'll make you say the West Coast ain't shit without Crooked
I own a vicious label, niggas'll get disabled
When I'm spittin' rhymes written on project kitchen tables
I load this 4-5 and let slugs dive at ya
Now that's for Crooked I, the scrap happy, mic snatcha
Daz:
Motherfuccers can you dig that, huh?
Can you fucc with this?
Let's get Kurupt the Kingpin to fucc y'all niggas up
Y'all don't wanna see none of this west coast mc shit
Yeah, how you like me now motherfucker!?!
Kurupt:
Terror starts, in the midst of your heart, starts
The storm, my vocals float like arts
In the mystic state of mind, when I create a rhyme
My microphone massacres every year the same time
With audio amputations, vocal thoughts of a loud talker
Up against the microphone night stalker
With a tendency of bashing mcs, like ten of me
As you can see I continue mashin' mcs
Caboom, the room gets cleared as my views get clearer
Extra-terrestrial microphone terror
In effect, get infected
Tell me what the fucc you expected
These venemous injections
I leave whole sections, and sections full of injections
From these poisenous melodies and selections
I select the methods of slow anguish
I mangle shit with my language
Tell me, have you ever seen one elope
With the microphone
In a scandal like abilities to make mcs explode
Baboom, alone in my own zone
So don't compare me to none
Not one's nearly
Severe, cuz I severely, impare mcs
Near me, oppose and fear me, I got plots and theories
Sincerely, I could have the spot locked
Niggas get stoned for touching microphones
With no knowledge on how to rock
Daz:
Yeah, back in effect, it don't stop
Turn your speakers up, dj Battlecat on the table
We fuckin' it up like this and like that, yeah
Got my homeboy Xzibit in the motherfuccin' house
Alkaholiks!
Xzibit:
When I was enlisted
I came to the table double fisted
Sadistic, heavy artillery, for all my enemies
Bust shots up in the sky screamin' obsenities
Make niggas sport cackies and chucks from hear to Italy
It'll be, a cold day in Hell when you see Xzibit fail
Act like a bitch on bail, tuck tail, and run
See we do it how it can't be done
I'm the rough cut, plus how the west was won
Or direct descendant of the gatling gun
Don't test me son, you fucc around and catch you one
That ain't a threat, that's a promise I can definitely keep
You can't compete wit' 25 niggas wit' heat in the street
Ready to repeat, round after after round at you
All hell break lose when the whole Pound come through
I found that you and yours, can never fucc wit' mine
I own shit but gimme some more like Busta Rhymes
Cross the line, now you gotta pay the piper
I'm The Alkaholik sniper, that be keepin' the crowds hyper
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Can't stop till me and my niggas is platinum plus
My Dogg Kurupt
Daz:
Yeah, no shit
Yeah, y'all can't fucc wit' that
That's what I'm talkin' about

Yeah, we did the firefights, we did the burning. I finished my first tour in Vietnam in March of 1965. I finished the second tour in March of 1966. My son was born in 1974, you all know him as Xzibit. I see a lot of myself in my son. He's taken a lot of risks for the sake of success. He's experienced a lot of the dangers of life. He's cultivated the values of a father's heart and a father's mind. He sweats, he works about his family as I did mine. And so, his battles, his firefights, much like mine, had just begun. But as all real men do, he will persevere",https://genius.com/Xzibit-outro-lyrics

Don't be a hero, and you won't get blown the fuck up right now

Startin now let's keep it rollin

Hit the bank from the back
Double the trouble, forcin my entry
The first nigga that i saw, shot him in the jaw
Xzibit started stompin him and so did we (get down bitch)
Aww shit, about time we started dumpin on security
High society -- takin what's mine
Snatchin each purse after purse -- for every nickel and dime
Premeditated created by the scorn and the hate
But i made ma, the big time, lights and the shine
It's a full scale war -- everybody bear arms
Wear body armor, national arms
Dip away to get away -- sirens alarms screamin
Yellin out, ""hell demons of war""
Hell hounds that surround the wells fargo browns
No tomorrow, hollow, harness rounds
Take a sip of your perrier
To pay, i'ma dump like a dumptruck, scramble to make my escape
Dat nigga daz, shootin so nothin else come in
I'm shootin in the opposite direction, we closed in
Shells spread nigga -- because we can do the work
First things first -- like snoop, i'ma shoot the clerk
And i did -- now it's time to split -- get nigga get
(let's go) dumpin and shoot the hostages

My life like a Hitchcock flick, stick to the script
If she can't stick to the script, stick to this dick
How she actin off of the fifth? Ridiculous sh*t
We don't need conversation, just crowd participation
If you here on vacation we got, rules and regulations
Seperate myself from y'all, segregation
Tryin to stop Xzibit and Dre? Humiliation
Pure elevation, got me some inspiration
Two b**ches in bubble baths, a beautiful invitation
Got a live occupation, live for the moment
I'm faced with an altercation manhandlin my opponents
I got eyes in the back of my head
I never sleep so they bloodshot red
Yo we so far ahead of our time
If we can stop life and press rewind
You still wouldn't catch up 'til 2K and a dime, so turn it up

 Turn it up!  Turn it up
 This is it!  This is it
 We the sh*t  We the shiiiiiiiiiit  Get with it!
 Give a f**k  Give a f**k
 Who you wit  Who you wit
 Turn it up!  Turn it uppppppppppp  Get with it!

Truthfully speakin, it's lonely up here all by myself
So I had to come down and pass around some help
From N.W.A to whatever's next
Make sure it says ANDRE YOUNG in bold letters on big checks
Your sh*t ain't sellin? f**k it, get Dr. Dre on it
You got a budget? I'll get down, give me half of it
One session, one song, I'm gone
The first week, you hit the streets, a star is born
To add to my universe - let me show you
Who can invade who nigga, and who can do who the worst
Warning from the Surgeon General
Watch out for fake hits and bullsh*t that sounds identical
Pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?
Twenty years in the game, with a constant buzz
Pick a year, any year, see how hot I was
Same sh*t today, and still don't give a f**k!


 Stay.. in your place  Stay in your place nigga
 You can't face, what we bringin
 What we bring to the game, playa

 Blaze your sh*t  Blaze your sh*t

Let me give y'all niggas somethin to hold
This product not to be sold
Know you can't cook it over a stove
You can flip it and come back with a mitt
Don't make me reach through your limo tint
I just want my twenty percent
This is dedicated to the people that spoke too soon
I think I'll stop shootin you niggas and shoot for the moon
Motherf**kers turn respect on and off like a light switch
I'll never be seen, like Farrakhan f**kin a white b**ch
Jump I won't flinch, dump I don't miss

Guns to the ammo, niggas think they rambo
Standin on the corner with they khakis and they flannel
Dang yo' flow sound just like d's
Who wanna battle three g's for t's
Please, read it off the lips of the alki-bumrusher
Fuck you up so bad, tony wouldn't wanna touch ya
Say what?
Say what?

I'll fuck you up so bad, tony wouldn't wanna touch ya
Say what?
I'll fuck you up so bad, tony wouldn't wanna touch ya

Lets get upclose and personal, malicious, sid vicious
I bang bitches, you might find yourself missin tonight
Rapper's delight, keep it at the house but ain't fuckin it right
Got'choo stuck in the headlights, can't move
Impact is all of the sudden, vehicular homicide
But I ain't stoppin for nothin
Me and my cousin, strong buzzin, and playin a dozen
Pushin and shovin', leads to gettin sucked and rolled up
Like a nigga with a mask and a gun, hold up
Rappers act like they ain't gon' die for small fry
Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy
I ain't gon' lie, motherfucker love to get high
Barely get by with scraps and pennies
Now we winnin grammy's and emmy's
And party with the henni and remi
Got a big bang theory nigga keepin it hot
Its the art versus ? ? ? or not

Miscellaneous
Killin' It
Ahh, ahh
I be killin it (why Tash?) cause I be feelin it
I get money so no need for stealin it
I work diligent beneath the Earth's soil
Where I write rhymes so fresh it's like I wrapped my styles in foil
But I sit at home and boil spicy rum when it's freezing
Cause I from the Likwid crew where we got drinks for every season
Maybe that's the reason why I live high all July
And the place I buy my beer is callin in for more supply
Maybe not, maybe so, maybe yes, maybe no
Maybe niggas got some friends that wanna battle for some dough
If you know somebody holla, cause I take those extra dollars
Split that shit with J and Swift, buy a ninety-six Impala
And lace it with the deez out my own stack of cheese
Get a extra flossy floss and toss King Tee the keys
And say, 'Nigga that's yours, cause you opened up doors
Before Tha Liks had a deal, you had a nigga on tour
So God bless ya, never let this rap pressure test ya
You know who got your back when them other niggas sweat ya'
So check uno dos while I roast this coast a toast
When it comes to beats and rhymes, you know who got the most
I be killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)
Tha Liks rock that shit that have all ya niggas feelin it
Killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)
J-Ro is up next to flow
Dat's me
I be killin it (killin it) when I be feelin it
Got rum in my cup, best believe I won't be spillin it
Yo Xzibit (whattup Ro) I got to know
Do I got that Likwid flow (oh fo' sho') well here I go
Mida, mida, down the barrel of my heater
I torch ya, then skeet out in my Porsche two-seater
I'm from the home of rattlesnakes and golden bears
And Astro-vans with swivel chairs hoes come in pairs
Plus, makin money's in my genes
That's why I got money in my jeans, I got a cravin
My mind craves the knowledge, my pockets crave the cash
My mouth craves the brew, and my Johnson craves the ass
Who's on blast, Tha Liks baby, don't twist it
Just rock it, got your girl's number in my change pocket
What's her name Stella, if she's on me kinda hella
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? is what I tell her
I get freaky like Friday, why dey, try to get loose
Wack MC's are like ?brown guts?, they have no use
I just got off the court, where I was whoopin some cats
In basketball, here's a question that I have to ask y'all
Who be killin it, is it the ladies?
Who be killin it, is it the fellas?
Who be killin it, is it the b-boys?
Who be killin it, is it the gangsters?
Who be killin it, is it the rastas?
Who be killin it, killin it, killin it, killin it...
See I be killin it, yeah, when I be feelin it
This is dedicated to the niggas that be stealin shit
Straight from the bottom of my black-ass heart
The untamed feel no shame, on top of the game
Mr. Big Bad Insane, black John McClane
Look listen and learn, you only get what you earn
So I'ma hustle like fuck regardless, watch my smoke
Go straight for the throat, we known for rockin the boat
It's hard to find like the grade A shit, with no cuts
Tryin to stack like King Tut, and still bang the microphone up
Demandin, clear lane for crash landin
If anything I'm guaranteed to be the Last Man Standing
Pick a number motherfucker whassup?
The circumstance make you shit in your pants, and we advance
As an avalanche of soul, and everything that shine ain't gold
Just cause niggas got brew don't make em nickel proof
My record contract reads hit man for hire
Xzibit showin grace under fire
Tha Alkaholiks killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)
 Tha Liks rock that shit that have all y'all niggas feelin it
Once again, feelin it
Killin it (killin it) drillin it (drillin it)
What, yeah, bring it live with the... yeah
Feelin it (feelin it) killin it (killin it)
Like this
 Party down, party down, party down!
 Bringin it live once again, yeah, cause I be killin it
(What, stabbin it, beatin it, yeah)
 Y'all niggas ain't heard no shit like this out the West coast
 Say what, wha-what, wha-what what?
I say what, wha-what, wha-what what? It's the likwid crew
 We be killin it, uhh, cause we be feelin it...

Thunder & Lightning,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Not havin it""
""My lightning my thunder""
IT DOES NOT END
""Not havin it"" ""My lightning my thunder""
""Not hav--""
Xzibit (lightning) Defari (come on) ""not havin it""
""My lightning my thunder"" ""not havin it"" ""my lightning my thunder""

Look what the wind blew in, a Wild West storm
In the form of Thunder and Lightning
Xzibit be the Thunder, Defari be the Lightning
Crack a shark's teeth when he be bitin
These fakers can't stand it to sell they bandit
Wit silver-tipped lyrics I shoot across the holy planet
Your favorite's Janet, I'm bangin hits that's hard like granite
Surprising these critics cuz that's the way I planned it
Your brain I scanned it, and analyzed your weakness
You're not creative, niggas like you we call leeches (say what)
(That brother teaches, yep) don't make no big deal of it
I just knows I don't half-step
The after high noon Moonshine saloon
That's where you find a table reserved for X and Herut
From Alaska to the Mellanys
Don't give a fuck where you look, they feelin Likwit emcees
Chorus 
""Not havin it""
Xzibit's da Thunder, Defari's da Lightning (4x)

Y'all niggas speakin out of anger and ignorance
But Xzibit got the diligence
Defari sparkin joints in the ligiments
Kill-afornia b-boys who search and destroy missions
Bring the heat to raise the temperature in Hell's Kitchen
Don't get too relaxed and find yourself missin, listen
Shot caller from a whole new position, relieve the tension
Break bread wit my brothers
All the bitches we fuck be hangin out wit one another
And associate my good times wit Hennesy straight
Can you relate, or is your heart filled wit hate?
We makin history, get your cameras and roll the tape
Document the moves y'all niggas refuse to make
How many fools do it take for me to shut down
To realize Likwit niggas ain't fuckin around
Feel the shakin underground sound will never provoke
We automatically swing hard and aim for the throat, mothafuckers
Chorus 4x

The Ice Age couldn't stop me from writin a page
Of lyrical rage to be taken out on stage
Then my frustrations slice emcess wit vocal blades
No dough, no show, no doubt gots to get paid
You listen to the horses *horse sounds*
It make these wack emcees wanna quit and go take college courses
And get a higher sense of learning
Clappin off ?vermin?, bust his spine and be the iodine that's burnin

Put your gun down boy, you get beat like your father did
Debo style, snap your limbs like a crocodile
Nasty, wicked, and wild and ready for the confrontation
You tryin to deliver but runnin into complications
Of course, the work horse, the main source
Either come in quietly or be taken by force
40 Dayz & 40 Nightz brought the Thunder & Lightning
Let's both burn sudden and have a Clash of the Titans
Chorus 4x",https://genius.com/Xzibit-thunder-and-lightning-lyrics
Crazy ho - xplicit album version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
Comin' from a cat, that uhh
Believed that if wasn't nobody else in the world to pimp
He'll probably pimp himself, that's me, Suga Free
Dig that, yeah, again? Uhh X man, y'know
If I don't slap her man, she feel like I don't love her
You know what I'm talkin' about?
This thing takes all kinds of turns and switches and changes
You know it's called the P Steady
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
Woman out the wilderness bitch
The homies say you got a wildebeest piece
But she a dime piece, her mind lost, thrown off course
She been divorced twice, overwhelmed by bad advice
From a past life, she crazy though
Call my telephone a hundred times in a row
I don't know how to let her go
I'm stuck with this ho, pardon me
But she ain't nuttin' but the worst part of me
She even threatened to slice her artery
I gotta watch my God Degree
She tried to voodoo the peas
And throw her eyelashes in the recipe
Please, it's more than she's spittin' in my lemonade
And R.Kelly ain't got the right to sing the hook like Butch
Yeah, come on, spit it
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
Now since chickens of a feather be cluckin' together
And I met her through Aiesha, I should've known better
She a professional charger Laker chaser
The kind that'll lie and say one of 'em raped her
But she in love with a gangsta
And it's been all trivial since the day that I janked her
Swore she wasn't ghetto but I met her at Fairmont
Shoulda knew she was a gangsta
When she said that it wasn't her man's car
But now she crazy over me
Tryin' to OD, 'cause she can't be with me
She'll fuck with different sets just to bring you beef
Fake a pregnancy just to get you fo' a G, crazy
How much can one man take?
Worried if I leave it's her life she'll take
So I'm stuck here livin' life in fear
Situation so severe
I need to change my ways
Pay more attention to the her hopefully
Thinkin' with my dick every night and day
And the bitch won't go away
Girl stop screamin'
All in front of my house, tellin' everybody you not leavin'
And just beat it, you're insane
Crazy and deranged and I don't need you
Look, don't make me repeat it
I'mma say it one time, kick rocks or I'm a call the one time
I should've hollered at your sister
We went to the same high school, plus she finer than you
Hey, baby this one's on you
You know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none too
You dug my man out, your hand's out, askin' for help
Hey, go 'head trick, kill yourself
I'd leave the girl alone, but the bitch keeps callin' me
All day and all night long, she just keeps callin' me
She says she'll kill herself if I try to let her go
Somebody pray for me 'cause I'm stuck with a crazy ho
And that's what I'm talkin' about, Suga Free
Up in here with Xzibit you know I'm sayin', west coast big style
We really doin' this out here fo' real homey
You know what I'm sayin', you all get to know
You know what I'm sayin'
You'll get to know yo' folks a little bit better too
If you just uhh, recognize this P, you know what I mean?
You know what I'm sayin'
We respect the hip hop, we respect the whole 9
You know what I'm talkin' about pimpin'
The bud is greener and the grass is greener
You know what I'm talkin' about
The pimpin' is cleaner and mackin' is meaner
You know what I'm sayin', dig that
You can be a stand up ho or a fall down bitch
And we mean this out here on the west, now",https://genius.com/Xzibit-crazy-ho-xplicit-album-version-lyrics

You can turn your back and then walk away
(You can turn your back and then walk away)
(Yes, uhh, breathe with me)
Soon be comin' the Judgement Day
(Ah, soon be comin' the Judgement Day)
(Come on listen, yo)
I know you're fed up, feel like you can't get up
Have faith, stay strong, keep your head up
Yo, it only gets worse, we in a world
Where your status and your bank account determine your worth
There's no time to rehearse, the clock been tickin'
Because we all started dyin' at birth, I speak the truth and it hurts
It felt like I was dyin' of thirst
'Til I was blessed with my voice, I move mountains with verse
The worst thing you ever seen in your life, 'The Passion of Christ'
Pregnant chicks buyin' rock, hittin' the pipe
It ain't like, I ain't tried to tell ya, misery love company
Keepin' the wrong company brings failure
'Cause people use people like paraphernalia
With a scam, with a scheme, with a dream to sell ya
But I ain't got nothin' but love for all my soldiers and thugs
To all of my women, we gotta keep livin', come on
You can turn your back and then walk away
(Oh, don't turn your back and then walk away y'all)
Soon be comin' the Judgement Day
(Soon be comin' Judgement Day)
Yeah, come on, Mr. X to the Z had to raise the stakes
Had to touch my people like T.D. Jakes
On the ground like a nigga flippin' crumbs to cake
I won't stop like an eighteen wheeler with no brakes
Bein' dipped in here on so each CD's weight
Niggas be fake, they speak what they can't create
You won't, see me break, I'm built for a tough frame
One-eighty-five and I'm still on huff
I was only 15, tryin' to pass that rock
Never got caught, just sat down, collected my thoughts
This is bullshit, I ain't got a plane or a boat
I'm just another nigga sellin' some coke, you know?
Had to grab life right by the throat, murder I wrote
My callin' for ballin' wasn't pedalin' dope
It was oversea convoys, bangin' out cuts
No police or government agency lockin' me up, so what?
You can turn your back and then walk away
(You can turn your back and then walk away)
Come on, soon be comin' the Judgement Day
(Soon be a comin' a Judgement Day)
What do you believe in? I believe in karma
And that fo'-five to drop that drama
Can't wait for the time when I meet my maker
Picture everlastin' life in Jamaica, time to wake up
Watch your thoughts, your thoughts become words
Your words become actions when the bullshit happens
Keep laughin', that's when the gauge start clackin'
Feel the buckshots smackin', have your body mismatchin'
Yo, I feel the devil tryin' to force my hand
Steady bringin' out the soldier in a peaceful man
See I was born to be all that I can, without a uncle named Sam
As you can see we just a part of his plan
'Cause first there was a war on blacks
And then there was a war on crack, now it's war in Iraq, come on
I never give up, I only give back
I ain't preachin' I'm just statin' the facts so let the choir sing

They say behind every strong man
Is an even stronger woman
Come on
'Cause she, was put here to defeat me
'Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want
'Cause she, not what I need
Yeah come on
'Cause she, blow my phone up, to reach me
'Cause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me
'Cause she, not what I want, not what I want
'Cause she, not what I need
Man, say with that suck a, she
I'm from a place, where they quick to say, ""Fuck a bitch""
And gettin' grits, off of pussy, try to get a hitch
But I'm a bachelor, stackin' it, drinkin', need to quit
Me and my clique, ride through cities like we own the shit
You caught my eye, looking fly, body lookin' thick
So who am I? I reply with my government
Exchange the numbers
Escapades for days, satisfying my hunger
Don't trip, you from a long list, a long line
Get in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time
Introduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman
I got 20/20 cord vision, seein' you comin'
Livin' my life, I don't need a wife
But you persist, tryin' to strengthen our relationship
But I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets
Without a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace
You ain't the one for me
'Cause she, was put here to defeat me
'Cause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me

'Cause she, not what I need
You found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit
Never seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit
Now them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat
I'm feelin' stuck, had to hustle up
The A.T.F., hit the house, had me shackled up
You lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out
You never let a brother down, when you stressin' out
You stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route
You could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out
And it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat
You waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me
I sat aside, thinking back to the way I was
The way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man
I understand that you love me and you want the best
But if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest
I rock a vest, baby
'Cause I, run these streets for my struggle
'Cause I, carry heat for my troubles
'Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want
'Cause I, is that what you need?
Yo come on
'Cause I, want family so I'm buildin'
'Cause I, want you just for my children
'Cause I, is that what you want, is that what you want
'Cause I, is that what you need?
And all this time it was you
Baby forgive me for the pain, I was puttin' you through
It's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true
I know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I must do
I used to think I was the man, wasn't havin' a clue
I wasn't lookin' for no love, but I found it in you
It's so true, behind every great man is a women
Every time you call me, baby girl, I'm a come runnin'
You got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life
I sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight
I seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down
You always given me another reason, I can smile
'Cause you believed in me, when there was nothin' there to see
My wife can be my better half, complete my family tree
Nothin' can stop us now, wearing the wedding gown
Watchin' your father, walk his little lady down the isle
'Cause you the one for me
'Cause she, was put here to complete me
'Cause she, wooze the earth, underneath me
'Cause she, got what I want, got what I want
'Cause she, got what I need

Cold world - xplicit album version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Justine, 19, just got clean
Fresh outta rehab with self-esteem
She ain't felt this good in a while
A new leash on life, a vibrant thang, a beautiful smile
Used to run with a circle of friends, who was skeleton thin
Sniff white lines off powerful men
But see, all that's a thang of the past, she got class
And be damned if she'd let herself burn and crash
She ain't from money so she startin' from scratch
It's hard working for scraps
It take everything she got not to relapse
Locked down in 9 to 5, but at the 9 to 5
She get sexually harrased and chastised
Boss is a married man, she won't touch him
Frustrated angry man, she won't fuck him
She's out of her job, at Basket Cakes
Least it came wit an 8, 2 lines to the face Goddamn
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it
Niggas will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it
He was on his own, at a very young age
When he learned from the streets, made everything change
He came up with hustlers, lost his religion
It's funny how money can make a nigga think he livin'
I ain't talkin' paper like Jigga or Dre
It's more like 7500, 9 ounces of lle'
That's what he say he can get for the flip, they thought the deal was legit
But he stuck him and split, in deep shit
Now his mother work for minimum pay
Live a positive way, she the first one at church every Sunday
Blind to the needs of her son, he's a Gatling gun
In the streets, jackin' niggas for fun
It's a non-stop search through the hood, but can't catch him
They found out where mom stayed and went steppin'
The evil that men do, but still we continue
With death and dishonor, for the all mighty dollar, it's so cold
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it
Niggas will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it
Only two choices, you can give it up or you can just die with it
He was 13, brought up in Baghdad
Ate with his right and made money with his left hand
Prayed to the east, 5 times daily
His mother and father just had a new born baby
Now his father was an Imam who carried the weight
And built his family on 5 pillars of faith
Never trippin' off western ways, it meant Nada
Pilgramige to Mecca to circle around Kaaba
300 miles away, British troops hit Basra
His cousin waged jihad and died with honor
He heard about the buildings on 9-11
And a man named bush on a search for weapons
Now here come the U.S., to crush Saddam
Wit 88 thousand tons of missile and bombs
But his family's too broke to move or find shelter
If they all had to die, they would die together and that's cold damn
It's a cold, cold, world, and you know it
Niggas will lay you down and take your bread, yeah and you know it
