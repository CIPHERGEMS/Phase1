Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you're scared of them four walls?
I was strokin' on your sister, she was callin' me her mister
She suck dick for a picture, it's Lil Yachty nice to meet you
I was juggin' off them stacks, countin' up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat!

Okay

I've got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, ""Wow""
My teachers like, ""Damn""
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll (woo!)
How'd you do it? Only God knows (oh!)
I want to know who's real until the time folds
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'ma stay down with the same niggas I came up with, that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan (woo!)
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12 (woo!)

24 karat that'll fuck up my teeth
Pussy so wet that it fuck up the sheets
Catch me posted right there on the street
Pocket rocket right under the seat
Wish a pussy nigga would try me
In the kitchen whipping up the heat
Catch Purpp, get his ass beat
Smoking purp and then I ash it
50 band jugg, then I cash it
Fucking your hoe, then I pass it
Purple and lean, that my passion
Make it disappear like it's magic
Don't come to the 6 where it's tragic
Bricks wrapped up in elastic
In Europe with a bad bitch
And all we smoke is that cabbage

I'ma hot box in the drop top
Now the coupe look like a crock pot
Old school cubes in my ear
Damn, they looking like Macintosh
Flyer than an albatross
Rims chopped like applesauce

Play with squares like hop scotch
Rims so above the rim

Dump in it, huh?

I'ma die fly like Aaliyah

40 thousand dollars on the coat
It ain't even cold, I'ma call PETA
Whip it up with the eggbeater
Whole band on one sneaker
Another band on the other shoe l-l-like a nigga on house arrest

Still ride with Glocks and them chops over lanos
Let off them shells have you duckin' your taco and come back tomorrow

Riding an i8s in a race through Chicago
Remember I used to rock Echo and Pac on that Balmain where I go
Blunts full of posto
Remember I used to get free bands like Rocko
Got a white bitch snortin' lines, they El Chapo
Loadin' up .30's and countin' up guapo get top in my auto
Oops, I mean mobile, on the way home to my house in Herbo Hills
Remember them nights I was servin' with no deals
Lil' bro on Ess, know he lurkin', he gon' kill, rollin' off four pills
My life is so trill, I made a name off my block like I'm O'Neal
Get face to face with them cops and I don't squeal
Snitch did a bid but he would've did more years
Niggas a ho still
Wake up, get more bills
Rich with my squad in Chiraq like I'm Bo Deal
While in Miami we ridin' on four wheels
Block 100 deep, got the opps hidin' for years
Pop out, go trill
Glock color oatmeal
Know what I mean, bitch it's brown, it ain't no steel

So they pull me over and see my teeth golden

Still the richest nigga over on my side of town

More wise and more clever
Ball so hard I need a letter, put that on my sweater

Got bricks out like sushi, nigga you a rookie

Saw his chain and I took it
Catch you off in traffic, bitch don't want no static
Then don't play like Magic lil bitch
I ball like I'm Kobe but it's 20, Ginobili
My niggas not foldin', talk down, cut you open
My neck is on frozen, Olaf
He put diamonds forever
We shinin', JBan$, he might blind ya, bitch
Talk down and we find ya, bitch
JBan$ keep that iron, bitch
October 30th like Mike Myers, bitch
G-wagon sit on the big tires, bitch
Bitch, bitch, JBan$

Never, never, never, never
Never ate the box like RD
 and 
Jimmy
I shoot with the semi, one eye like I’m Fetty
I look out the scope, just give me the scoop
Whenever you ready, his chest like spaghetti
That nigga gon' fold just like a futon
Would tell her jump on my dick but it's too long
I just bought a bunch of groupies with Groupon
Tell me what you want?
Told 'em, told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, hey, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, I keep the chrome in my jeans
Hey, just like a chromosome
Hey, popped it with calicorn
Hey, when I get on, I'ma fuck me a Capricorn
Hey, yuh, yuh, ah, ah
Chubba!

All of my whips got spinners
Chop the brick in half like it's the winter, Deember
Put ah nigga in a blender
All these niggas be pretenders
Pretendin', pretendin'
These niggas ain't winnin'
We still on that mission to get all the blue cheese
We got them clips just like a movie
She suck me up just like a smoothie

Pussy so gooey, she lick me up after she do me
It's Boat from the Sixer,
 
I'm cut like some scissors
I'm gone off the sizzurp
, I hit her from the back
Then hit on that back like she bizzurp
Eat on that pussy like it was some dessert
Minister, sailing team, take him to chizzurch
I don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be snitches
They just want my riches, they just wanna fuck on my bitches
These niggas, they can't
These niggas be jank
I might pull up with a sword like I was Link
Pull up with a sword like 21
Hit the strip club and throw bands just for fun

I'm talking the big fancy lights
The star studded nights with me

Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together

Shining bright under the shining sun
Like moonshine you keep it 99% with me
I'm feeling all your energy
I know you love to vibe with me
I know you love to ride for me
Your favorite thing to say is, ""Boat, I love when you're inside of me""
Your love is like a high to me
I love to go out my way to make sure you stay happy

Watch how she start feelin' clouted
She gon' suck everyone around me

I'm in a 'Rari, it's tinted
I fucked his bitch now he trippin'
Bitch my name Bin and I ain't in it
I got a way with the women
I got a way with the hoes
I spend my money on money
You spend your money on clothes
I broke my arm in the bowl
And I get 20 a show
I got my diamonds from L.A
I spent a check on that Rolls
I spent the check on her purse
Then I went bought me a vert
Scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm ridin' 'round the city with a stick
Make this muthfucka fishtail
I get surgical with the pump
Nigga call me Denzel, Training Day
I just might hop on the plane today
My jewelry on, but I'm plain today
Money on me, it might rain today
Give a fuck 'bout what these haters say
Bitch, I'm gon' get it
Got a friend with a friend, bitches come wit' it
Nut all on her titties, bitches gettin' freaky
These niggas wanna be me, bitch, I ball like Bibby",https://genius.com/Lil-yachty-guap-lyrics

And I hope you make it big one day
Let these niggas try you, I'm the first with the gunplay
'Member when your moms brought my dog on a Sunday
I've been trippin' lately, need to get out the sunken place
And you super fly, you could walk on a runway
You still mine although I know you hate me
I should have gave you the world, but I fucked up
Late nights on 14th Street givin' butt rubs
I tell myself in my mind that I need that
I see you and I'm scared what you see back
You come around when you want, I don't need that
I've had so much heartbreak that I bleed black

And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...

Yachty and boat have been working so hard over this past year and we just want to welcome y'all to 
Teenage Emotions
Well they both have lots to say they've been working really hard
I think this time Yachty wants to go first

I done did a lot this year
Made a lot of friends, some came, some go
And I still never took a sip of beer
Still fuck hoes by the pier
Still ride around without a roof
Still ride around with k$upreme sippin goop
And my managers know lots and lots of goons
So let me know if there's pressure in the room

I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done had sex with six different whores
At the same time on they grandmother's back porch
Yeah, I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

I used to wanna be rich
Now Lil Boat on the Forbes list
And my mom walk around with a frozen wrist
And my sister walk around with the nicest kicks
I used to wanna go far
Now a nigga up in the galaxy
Tryna figure out why these niggas mad at me
Sending shots while I'm livin' so lovely, like a star

The Race Freestyle,UnKnown,2017.0,"It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck, out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today

All that fake gangbanging get you slayed
Think you hard, you get robbed for your chain
Nigga snatch my chain, that's a man down, mayday
In a race bitch, always first place
Nah for real bitch, first place always
Shout out Diego Money, Mitch, and Lil Jay
SKTDDG, that's always
Free Big Reese, they're tryna give him more days
Never been shot and truthfully I do not want to
If she not fuckin', boy respect that she don't want you
Say fuck the bitch and keep it movin' 'fore it haunt you
Don't fuck many, circle tighter than a bantu, let's get it
Hate these niggas, they fake weird and they fake emo
I'm 'bout my money, give a fuck about your friendzone
These niggas tryna clique it up and run against me
I have respect but now it's nothing else against me
Had that truck buck, I turned it to a tar heel
She ride dick like a bike, wheelie back wheel
They say don't fuck your homie bitch, that's a no-no
I took my old homie bitch and kicked it dolo
Told my nigga's mom I'm sorry, yeah he still broke (bye bye)
But buddy got up in his feelings so it's fuck bro
She pop six, now she ride dick like a Volvo
And snorting way more lines than a barcode
I'm not buckin' but I'm ready with the arsenal
Hit his chest, now his name in an article

It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K

Y'all broke ass niggas was hatin'
Only difference this time is
He surpassed all y'all broke ass niggas

Uh, all day I'm rocked up
Plottin' on a bad bitch to come and suck dick
Cook French toast and clean the bathroom
There's piss all on the floor, bitch, go clean it up
Nigga, soaked in sauce, boy, they fiendin' up
Every night you pussy niggas dream you us
Yeah, you signed a deal but you ain't seein' us
200k, I coulda bought a Bentley Truck
Every pussy nigga at South By, we had to smash on 'em
Niggas say he wanted two verses but he was hella trash but he had cash on him
I'm remember TBT, used to have the CDG, shit was hella flee
Back when all my thoughts were accurate, in an Acura tryna chase a bill
Now I focus hard on closing deals so that when I sign a deal I gross a hundred mil'
Stuck between trying to find friends who want innovation but will still kill
Every day a nigga's mom's callin' a nigga up sayin' a nigga spend too much
Baby girl, I made more guap than the President did in several months
Fuck my annual taxes, coulda bought some land with several cactus
Just looked up in the mirror and I'm gettin' fat, fuck, it's time to practice
My side bitch from Sacramento didn't suck my dick 'til we hit Saks Fifth
But after that, she went 7:30
I knew she would from a little birdy
Head so good, got me unsturdy
Givin' free clout to the unworthy
Goggles on like I'm James Worthy
Couldn't get hard, told her lick it, make sure it's still workin'
Goddamn, Boat you hella wild
Turned your mother into a pedophile
Bet she wanna fuck me
All this gold got me feelin' lucky
My bitch ride with me like the bride of Chuckie
Nigga, run up, get done up
Flexin' to the sun up
Better put your guns up
I wouldn't go toe to toe with you niggas unless it's for guap
Pussy boy, get your funds up
18 years old, I made my first million
Now I'm tryna make 100

Tip Toe,UnKnown,2015.0,"Gang, gang on everything
I need that Johnny fucking Dang
From every ring and every chain
I think I need a new whip
I want the finest wood grain
I had to skip that bitch a grade
She gave RD the best brain
Then polished all my new chains
I think I need my wrist watch on bling blang
Earrings on ching chang
College ain't for Yachty but I'm going for my mama's sake
I'ma hit that ho 1Night then you gon' take her on a date
You gonna make sure that she straight
And I make sure my future great
Niggas talking heavy but they easy, bust like stemless grapes
2015, I'ma be eighteen, buying my own estates
2016 RD gonna be fucking hoes down by the lake
Wait did that in 2012
Damn RD you living well
Bitches ain't on me begging, but now I'm on my name ring bells
Linking shit like Zelda, so boy respect your elders
I might be younger physically, but mentally I'm older
And visually I'm colder
And psychologically bolder

I'm back again with backwoods
Hoe roll 'em up
Where were you from throw it up
Cuz all my niggas down to buck
SKT my fucking gang
NAZ my fucking gang
YC that's my fucking gang
'Cause Byou let them pistols bang
Peter Piper picked a pepper
RD ran right through your ranch 'cause you ain't real
Niggas drink a little purple and swear to god they so damn trill
Dirty south Titanium grill
Show your bitch who really real
Looking so damn rich you would've thought a nigga hit a heist
Dabbing with all of this white
Looking like a bowl of rice
Flexing hard I'm Jerry Rice, I'm MVP on every night
If I get on I'm living right
Sip dirty Sprite like every night
RIP to A$AP Yams
Money like a bank scam
Counting all my money on a yacht with my bitch Tam
And she came from Alabama, new whip paint on Tropicana
Make it seem like opera
I'm shooting shit like GRA GRA
In love with the big tatas
Su casa, Mi casa
Run in your shit and then take it
Stacking chips like Vegas",https://genius.com/Lil-yachty-tip-toe-lyrics

And she white like work

I got D Wade under my shirt
Monster truck rims on the Chevy
Got me up now
Water diamonds dancing in my chain
She wanna fuck now

Only time I drink soda
When I drink lean
Only time I'm geeking off
Is when I pop a bean
A nigga fuck with K $upreme
Then he fucking with me
Told these niggas not to trust me
I'm always gon' scheme
See that 32 is gon' stack
Put it in my backpack and watch it double up
Young RD from the 6 buckin on any nigga, I don’t give a fuck
Dumb dumb like a tow truck
On your gang gang, that’s an e-crash
Nigga want static that’s a e smash
Nigga’s not really stacking up the cash
I been livin' life low sippin Barney tear
I can’t wait to move out so I can pierce my ears
Put them rocks on my shit, got me look like first
I done talked to niggas once, It’s time to remember
I done dropped a couple hundreds just for my shirt
Nigga’s name not Ferg but I put in work
Pullin' off in a beam, make em skrt skrt skrt
Bitches all up on my dick, that shit’s startin' to hurt
I been workin' all night so my mom won’t hurt
Chopper chopper make em jump like he praisin' the church
Man, I pray a fuck nigga step up on my turf
Bitch It’s Young RD and I’m balling like Dirk

Yeah It’s Young RD
Shout out to them – shout out to them niggas at

No money can fill it, I'm hot as a skillet (Hot)

I'm in a Benz and I'm getting a Bentley
I'm reading texts from last night, she said ""I love how you bent me""
I just bought a Benz and it said ""please tint me""
You wanna buy it but you can't
So you're renting, you'll take it back in 6 months

7K for the for VVS, white diamond dentals

Even Stevens
Now Steven ain't nearly as even
But I want to thank you for the entertainment that evening
Yeah, we all laughed at you
'Cause we all know you wouldn't say that if you saw me on your avenue
We all know you aren't built for this shit
I was taught ""don't you dare buck if you can't back up your shit""
Every time I wake up, someone new is back on my dick
I used to get baffled, now I sit back and laugh like a bitch
Young as fuck and rich as hell, I can't get mad at this shit

Hold up, let me change the topic real quick

We got a fallen soldier on the internet
Don't believe my net worth on the Internet
It's a lot larger, my dream girl's ex boyfriend drive a Charger
So I know I got a chance with that chick
I used dream about bitches who love all this shit
I used to dream about girls who love all the dick
I used to wear gold so fake, now I iced up the wrist

Walked up in that bitch with two bitches you ain't never seen
Perfect parts got me so clean
Paint the Glock white, add the laser, that's vanilla bean
Oops I meant vanilla beam
Counting so much money that my fingers started turning green
Winning so damn much that I now here go by as Charlie Sheen

Yo bitch who my ass texting
Fucked yo bitch head, then I told her that she not a slut
Lyin cuz i ain't give no fucks
Drop my nut all on her butt

You a bonified bitch nigga
Hang around with them snitch niggas
Don't come to my hood the 6 block where I ditch niggas

I just stole a 18 karat diamond from your girl
N.A.Z against the world
Niggas talk crazy run up on his moms at the store
Hit her with the AK
Watch her brains hit the floor
Pull up gang galore
Raw dog a bitch
Give a fuck bout a whore
Bad little bitch she came straight from Singapore
And she wrap bricks better than my Asian whore
Diamond rings on me got me feel like Mike Tyson 99's world tour
I could never give a fuck I said that shit straight from the core
I remember when a nigga ass was dead poor
Now I bust jugs and make more money than before
Big bad wolf and this bitch kicking down your door
All these niggas washed up I found them on the shore

Fi
Fo

My whip dripping, too much candy in my paint
Bitches they love RD
They watch me, they love me, they need me like nicotine
Fresher than most, straight off the boat
Counting my dough
Just a red head boy from the city, Versace robe
On me like I'm Diddy
One hand on her titty
Other gripping money
Lifes so sweet right now
Better lock down your hoe
Before I come through your town
Living so profound
Watch them hate me now
Bitches used to talk down
Now they ride like Greyhound
They ride like greyhounds cause I did 'em in and out

I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face
I be dripping, too much water on my face

I be loaded, too many pistols on my waist
Let a fuck nigga try me, find me a skrrt
I'ma go, I'ma go straight to his house
Gold on my mouth
Coming straight from the south
Me, I look pop right now
Water dripping, someone give me a towel
Man I took off, someone gave me a roll
Good lean when I fuck on yo hoe
Shout out to Roll, that's my big bro
Who is these niggas? Man, nobody knows
Nigga get mad, I put dick in his hoe
Wrap it up, body bagging his hoe, hoe, woah

I feel like a pimp at Long Johns eatin' my shrimp
Surrounded by bad bitches, I thank god for all my bitches
Without all my bitches I would probably still have bitches
In that droptop Volvo all my migos call me Marco
Real nigga rule number one, never give out your info
Pocket full of pintos, different color like some Mentos
X be smokin' cigs, I guess he do it for the Menthol

Came in the club with bout 60 goons
And they all keep tools, Bob the Builder
Make 'em sing like Aretha Franklin
Youngest nigga in the world bankin'

Hundred racks, I got it on me like a bottle of paint
Double cup poured up, I'm on Easter pink
And it ain't no fun if the gang can't hit it

Cause she want that new coat
Put the 40 to his nose ayy, put the 40 to his throat ayy
And my necklace on froze
Raf Simons on my toes

Watch me whip the fucking snow
Cook the dope up with the stove

Straight out the pot, straight out the drop
Straight to the top, post on the block
Rockin' my socks, eight feet of guap
Move with the Glock

Pop in the pussy, it's wet like tsunami gang
Upgrade to platinum on my brand new diamond chain
Met like a sentencing, Boat finna make it rain
Kick down his door if he try me, come find me, I'm ridin'
All of my niggas go Stevie, we might take your TV
She fucked on two xans she though it was a roofy
That bitch acting goofy, I chill with Byou 
You chain smoke the loosies
I might pop a sixty deucy
That bitch looking dusty that hoe got the cooties
That bitch she can't  suck me if her teeth ain't pearly
And nutted on her face lookin like a swirly
I like my all my bitches girly, my French fries curly
Running just like Gurley

Pull out them racks on a nigga, he's so funny
He talk the most shit, but got no money
Tough on the 'net, but in person, a new Gandhi
Stand on my racks and I'm Mo Bambi
I mean Mo Bamba, anklets a new Honda
I need threes with TiTi and with La'Shonda
I get right, it's on sight for you newcomers
I got two solid fists for you mouth-runners
With the gang out in public, we ho hunters
Kick that bitch out the spot like a team punter
Think it's time I run up me a Bugatti
Got this bitch ridin' dick like a Ducati
Bought an AP plain jane out in Dubai
Actin' out for attention, the new guy
Got another lawsuit, need a new tie
Know some niggas switched up, turned Ifá
Know some niggas out West bangin' treetop
Made that bitch give me head 'til her knees pop
Switchin' sides on the gang, tryna ease out
Catch you slippin', we knockin' your teeth out
Tryna come down my block, need to reroute
Tryna see all that shit that you talk 'bout
Know it's cap in your rap, you ain't gotta lie
In LA with Zack Bia at Nice Guy
In LA with Zack Bia at Papis
I'm in Houston ho huntin' with Tati
I just had me a smooth little ten piece
Run it up
Stick on my back like I'm huntin' up
Yeah, if I let my dogs loose, they gon' run amuck
Quick to pull up with them 30s tucked

Run up, flatbread, lay low, stackin' tall
Hit his head once, body dropped, rest his soul
I got big guap, big killers, big pieces
She wan' fuck the gang, told that bitch to write a thesis
Pull up all white, lookin' like I'm black Jesus
And my new crib fancy like the Saint Regis
Niggas sweet as shit, turn 'em to a Reese's Pieces
Diamonds shinin' so damn bright, give a nigga seizures

Nothin' make me more happy than backends
I'm straight to no signal, them racks in
These new niggas' music is trashcan
He can't feed his fans, so they fastin'
He told 'em, ""Let's all go Muslim""
That bitch nigga ain't out hustlin'
I said take a sip, why you guzzlin'?
Give me my damn cup back, nigga
I'm too rich to be out here tusslin'
Buddy just paid a rack for some 'Tussin
Hope he sick, 'cause that's all that it's good for
I wish that my big brother did more
I pray that my lil' sister live long
Paint the 'Rari all yellow like Armstrong
Got a stock with a stick, it's an arm long
Wow
Heard they said I went broke, boy, was they wrong
I just cashed in a check, it's a phone number
Bitch, your ass on the porch like the door number
We gon' track your ass down like LoJack
Why they playin' with me? I need more racks
To the money, I'm runnin' up four flat
This shit right here gon' need four plaques

Run up, flatbread, lay low, stackin' tall
Hit his head once, body dropped, rest his soul
I got big guap, big killers, big pieces
She wan' fuck the gang, told that bitch to write a thesis

Lil Yachty Raps About 59 Simpsons Characters,UnKnown,2017.0,"You’ve got Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart
You got Maggie and Santa’s Little Helper to start
At Seven-Forty-Two, in a pink lil' house
Where everything’s coming up Milhouse, D’oh!
Grampa’s yelling at clouds
Willie’s really keeping busy keeping the grounds
Wiggum is commissioner, incompetent officer
And his son Ralph’s doing the un-possible
Springfielders, ask Quimby, there’s plenty
The black one is Carl, the white one is Lenny
So many seasons, you can’t seem to settle on
One, ish longer than Nahasapeemapetilon
Go to Kwik-E-Mart, learn what Apu earns
Hans Moleman was saying boo-urns
Like the Sea Captain, I’m going overboard
I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords
Like Brockman
, 
gimme a Duff, man
I wanna take a Malk but I wanna get drunk, man
Barney’s the barfly at Moe’s who falls
Down while Mike Rotch gives phony calls
Or Otto Mann on “The Bus That Couldn’t Slow Down”
Need a dump truck of money, call Krusty the Clown
Steer clear of Nelson, he’ll laugh at you openly
It’s worse than hearing “Okilly Dokilly”
Flanders, store just for left handers
Bar in the basement, call in Rex Banner
Two sons called Todd and Rod
Whose mom Maude got t-shirt clocked to God
And she’s smoking, like Selma and Patty
Comic Book Guy’s kind of a fatty
Like Fat Tony and Uter with his chocolate
Looking for another? 
Did you check your pocket?
I’mma school you like Chalmers and Skinner
Serving up steamed hams for dinner
I’m on fire, well, that’s a fallacy
It’s really Aurora Borealis, see?
Burns got a bear and the bear is Bobo
Burns got goons, Crusher and Lowblow
Nothing beats stabbin’ folks with my hobo
Knife,
 
bring back Sheriff Lobo
!
Flow so sick, someone call a doctor!
Hibbert is with it but Nick is awful
Hi everybody, it’s Mr. McGreg
With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!
Smithers can’t enter the League of Extra-Horny Gentlemen
There’s Itchy, there’s Scratchy, and there’s Gentle Ben
They’re all animals, call the hound dogs
Which are back like Alf with the Alf Pogs
Arnie Pye, Artie Ziff and Disco Stu
Martin Prince, McBain, Kirk, LuAnn, Lou
Sideshow Bob, Troy McClure, 
Radioactive Man
Who had a Fallout Boy before the band
I got more lines than Bart with chalk
I spit more lines than Maggie’s talked
That’s 59 names with more to report, Bort

Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya
You know that I’ll be there for ya
But you gotta let me know what’s up

Ohh ohh, Baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always has to mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape
And I’m getting tired
Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit just goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya

I'm sick of these niggas, I'm sick of hoes
Got a bone to pick with you, I'm pickin' a bone
The hardest thing for me is stayin' composed
'Cause killin' shit is really all that I know
Funeral goes, the casket closed
The choir sings, the pastor goes
Women cryin' in the rafters
Turn your baby to a bastard
Free my nigga 'til it's backwards
Shit, come here, 'lil bitch
Let me show you a magic trick

I got the gun in my lap near the aftermath
I took a break, but they want me to rap again
Bro just got out and he already trap again
Back at his craft again
New Chanel, tote that shit, sit like a daffodil
Bankroll thick, the same size as a movie reel
Tell me who keep it real
Niggas be frontin', fantasizin' my bitch
She look like Taraji
Take me out my body inside the safari
Couldn't dent the Ferrari, shit feel like a coffin
I use the codeine without coughin'
I sleep without tossin'
She call me daddy 'cause I'm bossin'
I had a show in two cities, call me Dallas, Austin
When I talk, I'm flossin'
They gangbang red B's like Boston, hmm
Everybody think a nigga lost it
Pop it out the cuts, make her burn like pollen
Dick up in the gut, make her feel it, Phil Collins
I don't read columns, niggas be hatin'

Pull out the pistol, they whippin' them naked
They chillin' outside of your whip and they waitin'
They'll wait on a witness with nothin' to say
I'm from Atlanta, the diamonds in Africa
I don't know algebra
I been the mouth of the South, not a traveler
Give her the dick with a curve, a parabola
I'm a spatula, I flip it, amateur
A Pamela, Angela
Palm Angels with a choker or strangler
Banger hangin' in my dang-a-lang
Lingering, peepin' out the scheme of things
If you got a problem, then I'll red the sea
I'm a lil' nigga, you ain't scared of me
Trill said he'd kill a nigga dead for me
But when he get out, I'll be seventy-three
Tell me, ""Go to Hell,"" I'll be waitin' to see you there

Lookin' for me, and I know I be in there
Plottin' on it, tryna be a billionaire
Snuck it in, that's how we got to be in here
Uh, come on, I get in touch with the cologne
Doin' so many donuts, the smoke fog up the ozone
Lookin' like Frozone
Told her keep to all her clothes on
I just want mouth, she just want Venmo
She let me score in the endzone
I put that ho in the friendzone
We put that ho in the friendzone
But she came over rockin' Kenzo
Bitch, I don't fuck with no Kenzo
Double, see me in the bando
Took her to church like I'm Chano
Don't change the channel, I go commando
I might just fuck on a fat ho

Talkin' 'bout you movin', blowin', countin' guap, boy, your ass cheaper than coin star
Talkin' 'bout you got the xans with the lean need to wake up from the dream
How many times I done told you before that I'm up next?

I can tell that he fu from the looks of his necklace
Niggas mad cause I'm stackin' guap
Fuck her friend straight for days
Fuck your hand out I got my ways, seein' goofy niggas like an xray
Hangin' out the window with the AK, this the new trap for the fly niggas
They like any of my ride or die nigga, I don't fuck with you that's on god nigga
And if you talkin' down he can catch hollowtips straight to the side nigga
Got the block hot, trail blazer, lemme show you 'round the whole trap baby
Pots and pans near the scale baby, rollin' up a whole 12 baby
I can't fuck with 12 baby, I really been stackin' up lately
Got a white bitch, look like Joseph lately , got the brown whip like a bowl of gravy
I'm a hot boy, these hoes crazy, I could never ever trust 'em

Ballin' soo hard I'm on NBA Bound

Servin' pints all around the town, bitch I'm drippin' and dabbin', and right then I'm in the wax
Smokin' thrax, sellin' thrax, pull it out my hat like a magician
I could write you a prescription, lemme stop givin' these niggas descriptions
I make music for the young and dumb, lean in my cup got my body numb
And my blunts fatter than a swollen thumb, damn, I do not drink rum, this purple
Got me geekin' like Steve Urkle, got your bitch out past her curfew
100 pack shawty, now I'm a walkin' lift, and (?) whip the brick

Do not try to run cause I got a stick, doggin' niggas just like like Michel Vick

Hopped out the back door, ran a four flat
That was like way back
Nowadays I just sit and laugh
Chopstick long as one giraffe
And I'm comin' through, clear the whole path
Walked in the damn spot, it was all females nigga, fucked the whole staff

Why you hate? 'Cause I'm too rare

Fuckin' on a bitch from Delaware

Tag still hangin' from it, had it for a year and I ain't even broke it in
Diamond choker so tight, tried to lift it up, shit did not go over chin
In the studio with Migo gang, everything we make is propane
Call ten bitches from the Blue Flame

Front row at the ball game
Who that is dunkin'? Shit, that's what's his name
I don't even fuckin' watch sports but my backyard like a golf course

I just talked to Sam
He just told me he stuffed 30 birds inside a ham
Drove it in a ram
Told that bitch to hit my phone when I come back in town
He want smoke online but in person didn't make a sound
Money on his head, shit shine brighter than a crown
24 inch rims got my truck sittin' off the ground
Teryaki bitches, send no swishes, doin' dishes
I just changed the paint on my whip, it look vicious
Shawty in my head, said my hair look like liquorice
Then she saw my smile, said my diamonds is ridiculous
My bitch hate my friends, said they all act so niggerish
But she gon' stick around 'cause I got more green than a Celtic
More green then an Irish, boogers in my bracelet
Look like I just caught a virus, can you dig it like Osiris?
Made a couple million and it only made me childish
Call me Pedi Peter gettin' a pedicure out in Panama
Been backstabbed so much, should've played for Razorbacks out in Arkansas

Yellowbone live on a  back in commercial
Hope you don't run up, my nine gon' hurt you
Percocet 15, I took it, I'm dizzy
She choosin', I'm picky, can't fuck if it's fishy
I got a new boo and she yellow like Jiffy
I hit from the side and I leave her, she miss me
Yeezy 700s, I might rock 'em mismatched
Smokin' exotic, it sound like a dispatch
I go to Spondivits to get surf and turf
I don't stay at Four Seasons, I stay at the Trump
Outside the spot, I parked on a speed hump
Watch 'em face up in my flat, got my feet up
She givin' me neck off a Addy, she be up
Cleanin' her face off like she got a bump
I'm in a old school, so my bitch got a rump

I think that’s my only chaser
I be iced out, water
I be looking like a crystal
Lil yachty on a mission
Rich gang, going fishing
Look at this, this snakeskin
I got bitches they can fuck me
I can take all your main hoes
Nigga wanna shoot the one now
‘Cause I just fucked on his main ho
Uh, damn, let’s get it poppin’ like Crisco
All these blond head faggot niggas
Running ‘round like Cisco
Huh, damn, ain’t nobody tryna fuck with me
Lil Yachty, I’m a buck fifty
Money tall like project building
Platinum teeth, and mountain silver villains
Beam on him, he look like Krillin
I be aiming at a nigga head
Lil Yachty want these niggas dead

I been flexin' since the 90’s
VVS’s in my timepiece
Only fucking on a dime piece
Supreme tee, number 9 jeans
Catch me riding out of town
Chopper hold a hundred rounds
24 karat gang
JBan$, I’m the one to blame
Sippin’ Act make the pain go away
Fuck these niggas, they lame anyway
Fuck on they main bitch every day
Smoking swishers makes me go insane
 out with the candy paint
Aretha Franklin, my chopper gon’ sang
Aretha, my chopper gon bang
JBan$

1500 on a pair of sneakers
Why the fuck would I sneak diss?
Niggas running with the swag
I don’t cease and desist
Yachty in the back running booth
Like a CD disc
25 for my fucking arm
Got me on Sprite remix
Free Quanny my brother
Now he locked up on murder
Won’t drop that lames on my brothers
Pussy be locked up for murder
You should just know that they shootin’
Home invasion intrusion
He shootin’, I’m shootin’, we shootin’

Beefing online but in person you rational

The shit that you rap bout, you know you don't live it
I got the coupe with the top, you can lift it
I got the coupe with the engine, go drift it
Diamonds, they wet like a cup of the mystic
Living this life, so futuristic
Stay optimistic


Off the top of the dome

Rocking  like my name was Jerome
You want the smoke, told the boy to come on
All of the gang members, what's up and I'm on
Fuck with the set, look at my phone
I do not club, that's not what I do
I stay at home and sleep in the stu'
Plotting on ways to build up revenue
Catch me outside on the old avenue
Been a star player, check the attributes
Been 'bout the guap since I had sessions too
Know they want the boy hung by a noose
Won't catch me lacking, I stay with the truth

Talking Shit*,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lyrics From Snippet

Yup, yup
30, you a fool for this one

Broke niggas still talkin' the loudest
When you doing bad, niggas the proudest
Need a deposit before the private
Too exclusive, you can't talk to my manager
AK chopstick, cock it back and I damage her
Back in high school had a bitch out in Banneker
Talkin' bout Stephanie used to  selling act to the felonies
I fuck  caucasian, ebony, indian, cinnamon
""Ain't fucking, come again"", never heard that before
Bitch off the X she bout high as a acrophobia
Geeked off the shrooms, she swear she seen a UFO
Brother had bricks like an old house chimney
Walk in the crib, that's the gang house reminy
Back in college I was fairly odd like Timothy
Now I blew up like you mixed the wrong thing in chemistry
And I give a fuck if you into me, fuck the industry
These niggas fake, my young niggas slimeball with the drake Niggas said you sweet as hell like you cake
Eat it up, eat it up off the plate, nigga
And I been poppin' and these niggas got animosity
I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins
Got a stupid bitch, she like doing pills, call her Mary Poppins
I could give a fuck bout a rap nigga
I could give a fuck about a pump, pump, pump it up old ass rap nigga
Talking about how it ain't gon' last for a nigga
Just to keep it real, I made more money in the last two than you ever did
I'ma stay down with the same gang

Shoutout Meech on Mars that's my nigga (Slatt)
One-eighty cash for Benz truck, go figure
Lean, not no liquor, it's all in her liver, she leanin'
I love God, but I be movin' 'round like a Demon

Pull up in some European, fuck up Niemens
Probably with a bad bitch that's Indonesian
Fuck a restuarant, you hungry bitch? Then eat the semen (Suck it)
You know I'm fresh up out the streets, I'm from that cement
And my city bankrupt, they see a foreign, then they know it's mine
If I die, my niggas did it, 'cause my opps don't come outside
A westside nigga fuckin' eastside bitches (All of 'em)
You weren't in that field, I just looked at the attendance, nigga

From the state of Georgia to Michigan
Got my brodie five bands not to mention men
My niggas wipe your plate like it's Wimbledon
Boat emblem, rims tall as a grembelin
In Atlanta with that tomahawk, no Indians
I won't slime on my dawgs for the dividends
But I slime up that bitch, 
Better tell a friend I'm not real like an alien",https://genius.com/Lil-yachty-from-the-d-to-the-a-2-lyrics

NASCAR in the kitchen, lil' bitch, I be whippin'
Leave a note on the doorstep so they know that I did it
 Nobels ain't  I be giftin'
Don't give a fuck what you talkin' 'bout, I'm from the trenches
Come from gunfire and split decisions

If you with the shit, nigga, show it, uh, ayy

Ay, Ay
We've been on and off for four years
So tell me what it is (
EarlOnTheBeat
)
Tell me what to do
I've been doing wrong
But baby so have you
Don't leave me by myself
Don't leave me all alone
Love is just a four letter word, yes I know
I just wanna know
Tell me do you love
Things that I do
The way that I am
Or do you pursue
Me as in my words
Or is it my life
Playing with my nerves
I'm not good with love
Baby girl I'm lost
I'll pay for you love just tell me what it costs
I'm not trynna flex, not trynna floss
I've been running up M's girl, come be with a boss
I know that love's a four letter word
Tell me what that mean
Tell me where you've been
Tell me what you've seen
Let's take trips to overseas
Where the grass is green
Unlimited drugs, mighty percs and lean
I know what you want.. I know-",https://genius.com/Lil-yachty-trance-lyrics
Můj příběh,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Můj příběh je prostý a začíná tady
Sedím si v hospodě mezi kamarády a
Zrovna když u piva upíjím pěnu
Naproti u baru uvidím ženu
Ta žena je krásná její neskutečný vnady
Mi řikaj' kámo - teď a tady
Tady a teď svůj šarm rozjeď
Kolem prstu si ji vomotej a pak si ji vodveď
Tak vytáhnu kytaru zabrnkám na city
Jeden dva songy - starý dobrý hity
A pak už jen čekám až zvlhnou ji oči a
Úplně hotová mi do náruče skočí
Ale co to je? co se to děje?
No to snad ne snad se nesměje
Proč se tváří jako bych byl ňákej hmyz
Jako by řikala: hele mladej, rychle zmiz
Tvý songy budou nadosmrti staře znít
Pokud v nich nebude hustej rap a vostrej beat
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
Nevim jak se správně řikaj hiphopový mantry
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny vás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele
Můj příběh byl jiný a začal tam kde
Pokud si opravdu dobře vzpomínám
Skončil ten tvůj u kytary a piva
A naproti mně se posadila Iva
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a country
Ty chceš repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny nás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To ti ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svíráš držíš jako ukulele
Ukulele ukulele uuukuuuleeeleee
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a kántry
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a kántry
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Wabiho i daňka posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele",https://genius.com/Lil-yachty-muj-pribeh-lyrics

Chodí nocí zlou
A kde nespí hodné dítě
Vezme si je ve své sítě
Houpy hou
Pak je veze ve svém voze
V dálku nocí zlou
Špatně se mu v noci spinká
Bez maminky, bez tatínka
Houpy hou
Na kozlíku starý cikán
Koně letí tmou
Přes bláto a přes kamení
V povětří se čerti žení
Houpy hou
Žáby spustí na močálu
Smutnou píseň svou
Netopýři sametoví
Probudí na věži sovy

Sbohem a šáteček,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Sbohem a kdybychom se nikdy nesetkali
Bylo to překrásné a bylo toho dost
Sbohem a kdybychom si spolu schůzku dali
Možná že nepřijdem že přijde jiný host
Bylo to překrásné žel všecko má svůj konec
Mlč umíráčku ten smutek já už znám
Polibek kapesník siréna lodní zvonec
Tři čtyři úsměvy a potom zůstat sám
Sbohem a kdybychom si neřekli už více
Ať po nás zůstane maličká památka
Vzdušná jak kapesník prostší než pohlednice
A trochu mámivá jak vůně pozlátka
A jestli viděl jsem co neviděli jiní
Tím lépe vlaštovko jež hledáš rodný chlév
Ukázalas mi jih kde máš své hnízdo v skříni
Tvým osudem je let mým osudem je zpěv
Sbohem a bylo-li to všecko naposledy

Niggas want the fame but all these niggas do is kick back

Dunkin' in that pussy, like Shaq attack

He who do not act, I don't remember no script

Could've been the fuckin' minister
