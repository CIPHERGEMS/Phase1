Mad Izm,Station Identification,1994,"Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin' this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic, yeahhh
Come on!

All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

The episode starts when I walk down the block, kid
Reach in my pocket, yo where's my knot, it
Follows me into the spot, compellin'
Go check the dread and yes he's herb sellin'
A punani gate, I'm a potential felon
Izm is smellin', like I ain't even tellin'
Channel one two, I'm smashin' the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie 'cause I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

Wake up in the mornin' got the yearnin' for herb
Which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kickin'
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the pickin'
So listen to the izm as it talks non-stop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin' but so is the chocolate Thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin' fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

I'm comin' out to dance with da spliff of sensei 
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-Z-M'n
I start grinnin', and syllables start bendin'
My style is intangible, like a wild animal
Check the label as it goes round it's on Capitol
That's what I'm smackin' you with cause it's easy
Like Lionel Richie, your whole style is bitchy
Switch me, mix me, somebody get me
Don't let me rip out my clothes like Bill Bixby
Rippin' the microphone 'til I'm motherfuckin' sixty
Smokin' the indo, by the window, it's sticky

Come spark the izm, my expertism, is lyricism
My flow will take you over, like I was hypnotism
So where's the lighter? To decipher, the skills that I'm bringin'
Hyper than a little kid on ginseng roots
And culture, my intellect will insult ya
Finish off your dead mind like a vulture
I gotta get mine, get a grip
Cause there's all these weak rappers steady makin' hits, FUCK THAT!
But '94, I bring the skills back
So listen now I'm doin' what I want to do and sparkin' mad izm

All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

I come with notions, deeper than the ocean
Check out my potion, mad rhythm in the motion
The izm, brings the wisdom, when I kick it on the rhythm
Check it how I rock it in a cipher
Desire, takes you higher, lyrical messiah
(Yo yo yo yo-yo, pass that lighter)
Counterclockwise, I rise like the sun
Now feel the heat from the rays of the gun
Shootin' out the mental mist
How you gonna know the real shit when your style's counterfeit?

His shit is counterfeit cause he's motherfuckin' phony
Come into the jam, try to front like he know me
Hah! Listen to this new type of somethin'
Bumpin', '94 ain't for no frontin'
New type of lingo, catchy like a jingle
Roughneck hip-hop is drippin' from the single
Now, let me introduce you to the one
The Channel Live indo this loosens you up
Goin' through the channels of the remote control
Flickin' through the frequencies of your soul

Then roll the izm, the inflater, I'm weeded
Like wearing a sweater, at the equator, I'm heated
But I flip a style like I flip a channel
Step up and test the skills, you can get my tes-ticules
Cause hip-hop's been running through my veins ever since
So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums
Till they can't flow. Why? Cause I'm drainin' em
Don't mean to be blunt but don't front
I'm doing it for the love so now I'm doin' what I want
To do with my Channel Live crew so just listen
Dissin' wack MC's and sparking up mad izm

All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
Mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
Mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

Sex For The Sport,Station Identification,1995,"Sex for the sport, the metaphor I kick is rhythmic
So listen, no competition, my love's Olympic
The pace that I set beats the mind until it scores
Waiting for the games to begin with my torch comes the javelin
The distance it can't be measured
The pleasure too deep, infinity marks the record
She's begging for my tongue to cease, so I halted
She wrestled me on the mat then up my pole she vaulted
Gymnastic flips and other tricks is how my game is
I'm live when I dive into sex like Greg Louganis
I don't come quick, sprints is not my meet
Sex for the sport a gold medal athlete

Can we sex for the sport of it, the sport of it?
Can we sex for the sport?
Can we sex for the sport of it, the sport of it?
Sisters bring your game to my court

Introducing, yes gives it to me and don't stop
My three forwards for boot knock
My main man Johnson jams hoops from the center position
To break her backboard's his mission
A guard name Jim Hats with mad control
His points to guard my brown balls to the hole
Or hoops no crap shoots, he plays close with Johnson
Johnson lost sense, caught a permanent bench
Don't stop
Bricks up my rock, rebound
Yes gives it to me
I stroke for the three
A trey was fouled for the four play
Back and forth, in and out my big brown balls sway
Then it drops
I got mad arch in my down stroke child
No referees so nothing's foul
We can get wild like the west
A full court press on ya chest with no twenty second rest
More plans than plants I don't miss backward tricks
Came out to see my Johnson slam out of flip
So don't trip
No need to bust your vocal cords
Crash, I shattered her hoop and her backboard


Stepping to my plate what's my fate
When I am swinging on a date I never rape
Just like I'm never singing
I'm wrapping when I'm batting
Louisville is hanging phat and fit the kitten like a mitten
Check my balls to see what's happening
I'm coming when I'm running to the 2's and to the 1's
Bases on your faces I hit the home runs
I'm not selling out
So I'm never popping flies
I'm going for the triple while I rose between your thighs
Forget the hi 5's
I'm collecting bucks
Wanna block me like a catcher but I'm coming like a trucker
I wear my hats when I bat
Correction say protection
Honey choke her for my wood cause I got the fat erection

So flip the quarter here's the order
I'm the giver you receive lay back
I've been in more sacks than quarterbacks
Let's kick off, this ain't golf
No little white balls to split ya up rights
I've been between more legs than Hudson Heights
She's on the rag, yellow flag, game delay
Won't touch her down for my brown balls it's out of bounds
I'm throwing hard balls and spirals, not Nerfs
No pushing up on breast implants, that's artificial turf
Like Buffalo I got Bills for Bears I Jets
I'm bucking hearing Redskins like a Raider when I sex
The Chief Stealer of a virgin of Saints I hit plenty
The flavor is 49er plus 20

Station Identification,Station Identification,1995,"What's your station identification
I spark a mental cypher lasting down through revelations
Take a trip into my mental cypher, I get hyper
Sniping-ass MC's, seem to get me higher
Like the buddah, bless the sess when I'm smoking
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin cuz there ain't no time for joking
Just lyrical bliss from the depths of the abyss
Rotating lyrical rhythms like the motions of the wrist
On a fag, I rag, wack MC's like Maxi
Pads, you can't see me
Intellectually, you shallow, mentally, you're just starving
I'm rollin on em like Calvin Butts up in Harlem
Wit metaphors, fuck a nine and clip
I make a rapper trip like white chicks in horror flicks
Identify your station or ?adjustment?
I'm transmitting, I'm giving MC's division, through diction
Cut em half, check the math, like magician
Conflicting pain on membranes
I'm running shit and killing flows like sewer drains
I maintain, no static feedback when I attack
Like Shaquille, oh so neal down as I appeal to the masses
I slash kids to ashes and dust, get strucked
As I construct skills that build, I don't be giving a fuck
Like chastity, my compacity's unlimited
Wit no gimmick, kids can't figure my structure like pyramids
I'm spirited like psychic and dead men resurrected
My wisdon's like prisms when light gets reflected, check it
My lyrical missiles, like heat suckers seeking
Never weakening, feeding off wack rhymers give me strength
Then I lengthen, wit no measure
Cuz I'm the ruler of styles, I rocket, the unidentified flowing object
Time for a station, identification
Wack rappers, open up your eyes, time for lyrical elevation
But you can't handle when I channel
Entering through mental panels, melting membranes like candles
Disintegrating mental matter, into ashes
Steppin up to rappers, just like the Titan Clashes
Bash an eyelash, my lyrical energy travels fastest
When propel by the leaves of Hawaii
Hardcore raps is about skills, so why do gangstas keep trying
I'm breakin on these muthafuckas like beat, street
I beat other rappers like Sega meets beats, the beat meets
Vocal technique like Panasonic
My rhythm moves in motion cuz my skills is like bionic
Identification, station switches wit my lyrical hydraulics
I'm cosmic, the unidentified flowing object
I find that you can't defined this, other rappers are blind to this
I'm seeing, you're bleeding from your sinuses
Cuz I'm on a higher plane, I'll be frying brains
I crack heads like cocaine addicts, automatic
Dramatic, I break backs, I'm chiropractic
I got mad, drastic tactics and static
Gymnastic styles it seems
Cuz I be flippin and balancing beams
Of radiation, devastation, you're facing, no tracing
You can't sketch a figure, abstract, no pullin' gats
If you're wack, my rhymes are triggered, you're dying quicker
I jack, cuz I rip a weak-ass rapper, I shatter
Cross em, toss em, the more erratic, flow patterns them in the war zone
Females, you need braille, you can't see what I'm speaking
In fact, your delinquency can't see my frequency
I speak to thee in tongues like the exorcist
You can't test this, I resurrect wit correctness
I'm defying like death is
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station, check your station (3x)
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station, identification
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station, yo, it's time to come real, now yo
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station identification, where you at in '94",https://genius.com/Channel-live-station-identification-lyrics
Reprogram,Station Identification,1995,"{*scratched: ""Reprogram"" - 2X*}

Internalize, externalize, check the exercise
Kick the lyricals, the buddha smoke, help me reach my high
My eyes bloodshot, buckshot, for the props
Say what you didn't know tell me why'd you sleep on Hak'
I'm not Sealy Posturepedic, the +Boom Bap+, I need it
To get this shit correct my style comes orthopedic
Get off my dick fucker, don't play me for no sucker
Herb
 I'm not a nerd 
I smoke blunts and kick verbs
When I serve ya like Agassi, pure agony of terror
Try to catch the beam of light reflected in the mirror
Never basic shit is dope cause I laced it with the flow
Ignorance is a sin when in my cyper so you know
Infinite potential, residental is the ol'
Illtown New Jersey
 if you heard me Glock the bow
One two three BDP troops hard
Any questions I was blessed with lessons from God
{*scratched: ""Reprogram"" - 4X*}

Three, six, oh is the flow
I got so many styles I come full circle
I treat you like a jock strap, cause it's my dick you jock
I got more props than Hollywood backdrops
I swing your head like back and forth like tennis
You got no lifestyle cause your style don't exist
I got the code for the green flow and yellow hits
I treat MC's like red lights, cause I be runnin shit
Causin drama, repents crazy like J. Dahmer
I'm hot like a puff goose bomber
And spittin on your crews, and re-fuse to lose
And get bruised rap's got breaded, I pay dues
I am me, don't try me G
I rip the beef off your back
You fuckin with the lion in me
I got troops, for soups or groups
They wanna stoop they get SLOWED DOWN like parachutes
Rippin ship my flavor kicks, like Ken-Bo kicks
So hold on, you never ever fuckin get it
{*scratched: ""Reprogram"" - 4X*}

Pass the +Boom Bap+ for the rap intoxicated
Pass the +Boom Bap+ to get my head elevated
Your man hesitated got done with the quickness
Cause the BDP crew, always rolls with the thickness
I'm soakin up your flow, on your neck I got the bounty
I heard you're hot and wearin a Jheri Curl in Compton County
It's Channel Live, I'm touchin on your brain like that
With the flavor for the roughneck that thinks abstract
When the chronic hits, I throw fits like epileptics
If you can't understand it, motherfucker just respect it
Rethink, replan, refine - react and redefine
Rewind this ridiculous rhythm and recline
Realize, as I reword, restructure
The rap game, you can't resist or recover brother
I'm like no other, I smother
From the sub-level thoughts, +Deeper+ than the movie +Cover+
But I'm not like Larry Fishburne, the mic burns
I rap with no delay, I turn-more-styles than the subway

Homicide Ride,Station Identification,1995,"If Hip-Hop was a bid, kid I'd be a lifer
No jokin', bloodshot eyes in the cipher
My third eye's always scopin'
To leave a head wide the fuck open
Like a sniper armed with ballistics, sub-control thoughts
Simplistic flows, cerebral assaults
Weak MCs get me pissed like a urinal
One slept, stepped straight into his funeral
Put this flat-line fake rhyme
Too disgracing with my mind
Point blank up to his face and ""booyah""
The mental damnation
Gotta start tracing into a
New round, a journey to the other side
With me at the helm, he couldn't burn me
The results of the autopsy
Caught by verbal lead he couldn't lyrically stop me
Tight flows made MCs schizo, phrenic
Your * cisco's ? * caught in this rap epidemic
Cause I wet it, sucka MCs will regret it

You're ready for the homicide through your mind
You gonna die, you gonna die, gonna die

Here's the physician
Time to kick the lyrical analysis
I'm tappin' on your spinal cord until I reach paralysis
Now just sit still, this won't hurt a * taste ? *
Fuck the physical I lay your mind to waste
Rhyme like an anaesthetic breathe deep into your nose
Feel the pleasure move, now watch your eyes start to close

Intellect injected on the track like a vein
Trailin' up the arteries I'm comin' for your brain
Skull division, the incision rips the cerebellum
Brain membrane starts to burst cause I swell 'em
I make your skill come back from the gravel I unravel
As words, penetrate fucking up your mental state
More anaesthesia, your body catches amnesia
Lost control of how to eat, shit, piss and breathe
Ah his heart beat quickens, seconds keep tickin'
Time eternally I keep that asshole shittin' from the words
Projected out in cryptic it's the mystic
Was it really suicide, insanity was inflicted


I'm on a homicide ride through your mind
I focus on your eye's eruption, they shatter
And pieces scatter on the pavement
Insane bloody thoughts gush from your conscience
As I launch this attack through your eye cracks
* ? This verb will enter ? *
My structure turns to a blood cell yeah
Other cells ignite to make your diaphragm yell
Speaking in tongues like a demon, while I'm schemin'
How to turn this homicide of your mind to a suicide
It's do or die, I'm a goner
Got me trapped into a corner of your mind
But I metamorphosize
Bending like vision, multiplying
Now I'm a hundred deep in your head
And your brain cells are crying
Blood pressure’s rising, from confusion
It's your mind you're losing, now
I hold your thoughts hostage, with my intrusion
Jumped off your instincts, then go make a purchase
I convinced yourself to take his life, it's worthless
Ropes, chains, anti-freeze and the forty four
Flex still I relax there's ain't no pressure, no more
Wait, who's that, a second thought try to catch wreck
He didn't know I had all your reflexes by the neck",https://genius.com/Channel-live-homicide-ride-lyrics
Down Goes A Devil,Station Identification,1995,"Booyaka! Down goes the other man
I stand with bloody ass hands like Redman
Cause I just choked another
Called me in, provoked a brother
So I flipped the script like Danny Glover
The other day, chilling on the lines of unemployment
I feel like flipping and killing devils for enjoyment
My madness, started at the age of 12
When devil's burned down my house like we was living in Hell
It Ain't Hard To Tell like Nas, I'm in a rage
This planet is a cage, I'ma bust like a 12 gauge
From pressure and stress isn't something that can't be forgiven
Is it a dream or a dream that we be living?
 {x2}
Booyaka! Booyaka!
Down goes the devil
Down goes the devil
Down down goes the devil

Putting my head to bed, better yet I rest my dreads
Thinking about these devils and how they got me fed
Up, it's time to gun buck with my shots
Any questions for my attitude I just say, ""Why not?""
They've been fucking us
And they've been crushing us
Who stole 200 million from accounting, it wasn't us
400 years of murdering and pillage
Is why you get my middle finger walking through the village
Why increase the peace while beast increase the pressure?
I'm tired of the lecture, the speech is getting trifle
Brothers killing brothers, time to redirect the rifle
To the one who was born in the mountain of the Caucus
Now you're starting us
Walk us in the mall of , devil's trickery
Fuck the bickery with the west
The devil's got the hollow points pointed for my chest


I walk around maintaining not to be a rebel
But everywhere I look I go there's another devil
He plays a roll like ya down, faker than an actor
Before he gets to me, I'm tracking down a damn cracker
I got mad stress I can't take it no more
Day after day devil's follow me through the stores
Like my pores is sweating me and upsetting me
I don't steal but I wet ya G just for testing me
I always be looking in the mirror of my Land Rover seat ah
The overseer, pulls me over
Just cause I got a Jeep with a phat system
Put down your gun we can toe to toe mister
He thought he was slick like breeze the devil pulled his piece
You figure, he didn't know I was quicker
Non stop shots for Rodney King that's a given
Is it a dream or a dream we be living?",https://genius.com/Channel-live-down-goes-a-devil-lyrics
Build & Destroy,Station Identification,1995,"Yo Kris.. yo, where that shit at yo?

I'm buildin foundations like a mason, I rock

It's the blueprints of sense, {?} submit
Rough and rugged so yo fuck it, my armor can't get dent
But technical, yo, I got mad precision
I'm wired like 'lectricians, got wind like air conditioners
My position is the foreman, I got more in store man
I know you dig this shit so stop frontin like the doorman
Now back to the schematic, get dramatic with the scene
Hittin nails on the head, like a carpenter with beams
Yo this ain't no dream, so don't sleep or slumber

Other rappers just get dumber, I just get smarter
She rock from the start, to make my lyrics harder
I reveal the deal so I'm somethin like a revelator
If it's over your head get your ass on the elevator

I build constructions of skills for destruction
Breakin through walls like wreckin balls
Demolition is the mission, you're facin
Whack motherfuckers need renovation - so face facts
I'm harder than hardhats, I jack like a forklift brain
I'm penetratin brainframes, with the truth as my jackhammer
Check the grammar, collapse ya structure
Surroundin and blockin off suckers
Like barricades, I'm blowin up like the World Trade
My center, it reads danger, don't enter
Down with {?} like a build and destructin
You're crumblin, while you're mumblin, sayin nothin

Lock it Up,Station Identification,1995,"My shit is thick like a wooly headed black Jesus
I was born to win skills like my nappy stuff
But when I gots my nappy stuff I got a flake or two
These irritatin flakes, I wipe them out the whole crew
Shinin through like the coconut, all on my scalp
Hey these irritatin flakes act like locks cause they dread
When I flex my nappy stuff, there's no whack jheri curl juice
In other words, a weak raps I never can produce
So cut them jheri curl raps, and try again naps
In skilled hard work, professor needs wax
Cause I got as many locks as the skins I busted
Extensions get dissed cause they can't be trusted
But I love it when they blow it feels good to my head
It's about the same length but two inches thicker
Like a dread from my bobbin head I swing back and forth
Suckers on me like my locks, they stuck to what sauce?

MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)
MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)

As my dreadlock twist like a fist I got the punch
Givin knots like my locks, I roll 'em up like blunts
Twirled in the riddle, just bring the comprehension
I kick that real shit, not the whack extensions
Pay attention did I mention, descended from Egyptian
Relaxed her then I waxed her, gave the girl kiniption
Fits, misfit, when you use that curly shit
I'm connected to the source, so I can make the hits
Like fuck it, I'm gettin, the ducats by the buckets
My naps are God given, so yo I can't destruct 'em
With the lye, no lie, so I bust the hemp
If Jheri wanna step, I slam him like Kemp
With the supersonic boom, we got the dreads in the room
With the actual, the factual, the self-manufactural
Diggin up the whack synthetic, pathetic
Hardcore to the roots, so I keep my nappy dreadded

MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)
MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)
MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)

In your cranium, MC's I'm slayin
They get licked and clipped like barbershops so just be fadin
Now barby master, rhyme styles get boasted
Hesitation, just wait a second, for those rappers
Who couldn't guess my combination, cause I got 'em locked

What! What! What! What! What! What! What! What!
What! What! What! What! What! What! What! What!

Some rappers, would they be without the use of the word nigga?
Time to make the switch, from the word bitch
Here's the message, catch it, no more Steppen Fetchit
(Rounds about clowns, here comes the verbal Hessian)
Modern day slaves, niggas'll trade for the riches
Our brothers ain't niggas and our sisters ain't bitches
Mental psychosis, negative osmosis
There will be a pimp, with some new type ho shit (yeahh)
Self-esteem knockin, yo I ain't your nucca
You call my moms a bitch, here comes the fist so buck up
Nigga means less than countin three-fifths
Conciousness seperates a woman from a bitch
If you visualize your woman as a bitch you'll treat her thus
If your woman is a bitch, then your daughter is a puppy
Raised her as a slut, dog scratch the itch
Up, Sugarwater taught her how to be a bitch
Skip past the bitch, and treat her like a woman
Your brother is your brother, not a nigga, fully human
So yo bust the track, this is how we act
If nigga/bitch is on the verbal it's time to counteract
What! What! What! What! What! What! What! What!
What! What! What! What! What! What! What! What!

Sisters walkin around got it twisted
Brothers rollin around like they holdin
The shit is out of control, it's out of control!)

Cause and effects, effect equals the cause
Must be a jig-saw puzzle
Brother love the pieces put together
Illfully clever misfits, bitches to bitches
Bitch-made sister, made ho by the mister
Broke by my fist-a, I'm fed up, head up with conclusions
Mass confusion from the words we be usin, or choosin
A lingo, hatches, matches like bingo, nigga
Nigga makes a nigga pull the trigger on another
Yo brother equals brother
Nigga pulls bitch so deep in the ditch of degradation
But little is my civil-, this my -lization
Makes nation, station, vary like a letter
The header from my dick, N.W.A. fits
Like a dog to a bitch, nigga equals hypocrite
No portion of the foots, the foot don't fit
In the shoe and I choose to be effects of the cause
Applause because the black's breakin bitch-nigga laws
Laws of the tracks, niggas to blacks
So stop the nigga/bitch, yo what's up with that diss?
What! What! What! What! What! What! What! What!
What! What! What! What! What! What! What! What!

Yo, act like the queens that you supposed to be)

I kick the real to the Public so I'm an Enemy
I Souljah Sister/since the scene get respect like the queen
I give it to 'em then I'm Swayze
A Hoodlum that's Intelligent for the Books
To keep from going Krazy like Drayz
A Poor but Righteous Teacher for the dead
The diabolical from the Soul, De La Soul however said
Now press the QB, you can't brand me with an X
Cause my Clan rolls thick to light MC's quick
Like a Flash I'm Kool like Hercules
So I'm Black like Africa so I Bam on the boom bap

(Who ya represent?!) We represent hip hop
Kicking mad metaphors that just can't stop
(Who ya represent?!) We represent hip hop
Kicking mad metaphors I just can't stop

Yeah, this the way we rolling in '94, you know what I'm saying?
Straight lyrical concept, going out to all those who understand
You can't disrespect and get with it you know what I'm saying?
Going out to my man TJ,  Noe,  and Disco, Feeds the Music
A Noisy Neighbors, rocking like that
Going out to my man Salaam, uh-huh and all those  Buckshot, Buckshot

Ghetto B.I.,Armaghetto,2000,"Yeah, hah, we vibing, Channel Live-in
All day, hah, come on! Yo!

It's me, the M-E-T-H, I O-D and you want dope shit
Sniff a hold ki, my code read be my conscience
Telling me it don't make sense
Then God is nonsense a nigga's best defense is his offense
So yo I watch po-po, and ducking dodo
Thirty cent a go-go, trying to steal my Mojo
Oh no, you're fucking with a pro who go for dolo
For sure though, I seasoned veteran, holier dobo
Come on now Judge Judy, you're telling lies to our vision
While our black youth get imprisoned
When my eyes see through your eyes, you're hypnotized
Subconsciously you change the station to Channel Live
That underground hardcore sound, who said it died?
Cause win in this, me and nine's the first to fry
For a nigga, live by the fire, die by the flame
Happy I'm gone, knowing my son gon' be the same
It's the diggy-dog DAT, who put his feelings
On the pad with the pen, Unleash the Dragon again
Uh, I'm on ya, like hot grease on a skillet
Gorillas on Real TV just living with us

I'm living like a hundred
In a Jeep, stolen, wolves in sheep's clothing
All beef frozen, bust like cheap Trojan's
Naturally strolling, blunts and weed smoking
We keep choking, bitches on their knees open
I spit like a automatic, semi-bark and park
And if you hear me starting, blame the Remy Martin
So lick a shot, ghetto people, dutches and c-lo
Ducking the repo and fucking a lady seal
Rhymes by divine ego, smoked out in a Cadillac Regal
With a mommy on my beach-o
There's eight million stories, only six million ways to die
There's two million niggas getting away with crime
Plus two million more wack niggas trying to rhyme
Now that's four million niggas trying to eat at one time
It keeps the thugs gunning and blood running
And the judge fronting, enough to make a nigga touch something
[Chorus: Method Man (Rowdy Rahz) 
Tuffy
]
Niggas fucking with that strick-nine, they might not get mine
So they owe me big time, it's Ghetto Business
Niggas jack cars and rap stars watch at the gas bar
Bitches dancing naked on their lap, it's Ghetto Business
(Niggas hold ones, hot ones, stay in the biscuit
Ghetto nigga so of course it's Ghetto Business)
Blunts and weed son, ghetto seeds son
I got what you need son, it's all Ghetto Business

This is for the senile walking on the Green Mile
My lyrics be like the spirit of a teen gone wild
Shit it's after ten bitch, where's yo' child?
The nine in this pocket, locking it down like P now
I did the knowledge to the born, your style is straight corn
I woke up in the morning, heard yo' shit and just yawned
You fucking up my high, no lie, you could die
So just ain't for my mind yo 'fore I break you up like Guy
It's the, Earth clinger, new style bringer
Rappers fronting in the war, playing fat like Corporal Klinger
We still bring the hardcore with R&B singers
While the beast ask you out like hoes on Jerry Springer

Yo, Rowdy, hot balls, flow so sick
And I won't stop 'til I'm so so rich
While y'all niggas spit I, blow hits
Don't waste time, son I don't waste rhymes
You minute shit, track done like squids
If you ain't hot, come like this
Real niggas hold the gun like this
Pop something, one in your leg
Make your ass run like this, now picture that
Defeat Ral? Never that, son son you brave
You ain't a man cause you got a little something to shake
I've been a thug since the sixth grade, rocking the fade
Young to me, look what the ghetto done to me
Made me bolder now, heart colder now
Brick soldier now, gun holder now
Niggas snatch my chain? Catch and hold 'em down
Hit him 'em with the hot slugs, life over now
I know you wanna test Ral, what you waiting for?
I live one-thirty-eight, basement door
City and north, you can't escape the Ral
Find me where Channel Live be at
What is this? Ghetto Business
*beat switch*

You ain't gonna blow up shit, you're merely a bomb threat
How the fuck you gonna move a crowd?
You ain't moved out from your mom's yet
I'm a vet., better yet a vet-er-an
The word Smif-N-Wessun like Megatron
Understand, I'm past hip-hop
I should be put into tiny zip-locks
Distributed by those who flip rocks
Leak use after wordsmith be
So dope you better sniff me
And learn to keep me out your mouth
Get me, I'm going to Armaghetto, swiftly
My whole, clique be, sickly
So we don't sleep, we spit in bed
Those that's trying to get hit in the head
Fuck around and get hit in the head
Everything I write is either a death sentence
Or a bloodline for those who, love nines
We don't stand in club lines, we VIP
Thugs love to hear me spit that
If you ain't down with Ghetto Business
There's exit, punk, hit that",https://genius.com/Channel-live-ghetto-bi-lyrics
Six Cents,UnKnown,2003,"You see that shit right Tuffy?
Let's just analyse society and reality and what's really going on man. Motherfuckers claiming they making sense...the only way they making it, is in they pockets, you know what I'm saying? Dealing with currency. Mentally ain't nobody doing it, you know? Do you understand?

Six cents is your six sense where's your sense?
Ever since I got my sixes everything makes cents
 Spent they cents making no sense
My sixth sentences will get me  non sense

Trekking through the dense surrounded by your fence
Six pence for the sense using for intelligence
Ignorance gets cut like a sickle with the nickle plus one penny
Tell me do you have any?
Six sense for the thought
Six sense gets bought
Sold out without six, don't get caught
Without sense, common sense, six cents is essential
More tuition intuition
Six sense gets potential
Smoke weed (indeed)
Cut leaves like a sickle
MC's mislead, when I got dimes for a nickle
Can you sense it?
Can you sense it?
Don't you dis spend it (expand it)
Intelligence expands, ignorance condense and fenced in
(Fenced it)
So read 'bout what I've hidden
Ain't nothing changed since so motherfuck Bill Clinton

So who makes cents but they ain't got six sense?
Giuliani made cents but he ain't got six sense
Our teachers make cents but they ain't got six sense
Bob Dole makes cents but he ain't got six sense
Preachers make cents but they ain't got six sense
C. Delores made cents but she ain't got six sense
Afu could make cents but he ain't got six sense
Potacki made cents but he ain't got six sense

My sick sixth sense to make dollars out of cents
Since all I need to stay alive is my sixth sense
Since some get killed over non sense
Tense brothers pack for those who act like they lost they sense
How much sense does that make?
No sense, so to ease my sense
I spent my last cents on sensimil'
I seen some, pulling triggers
But it's not the trigger that kills, it's the senses of a nigga
With no sixth sense, don't know his essence
It's Asiatic/African, God ever since
You won't check your pockets for your six cents
And the only thing you got in common with yourself is your sense

So who makes cents but they ain't got six sense?
Politicians make cents but they ain't got six sense
Pat Buchanan make cents but he ain't got six sense
The beast makes cents but they ain't got six sense
Ricki Lake make cents but she ain't got six sense
Talk shows make cents but they ain't got six sense
O.J. made cents but he ain't had six sense
The revolution made sense but we ain't got six cents",https://genius.com/Channel-live-six-cents-lyrics
Put it On a Nigga,Armaghetto,2000,"Wilin in the club smoking hash with my niggas
???? liquor put my mack on a strippa
But she gasped on a a nigga flashed me her figure
Ready to take this bitch in the bathroom and hit her
This other nigga stepped up tryin to rap on a nigga
Tryin to battle spittin bull trash through a nigga
Must have been blazed off the sacks we deliver
Cause my rhymes on the scale be the last on the rhicter
This nigga had ice, I'm about to jack like the ripper
I chill cause I'm still tryin to get ass from the stripper
Bust up in a mickey from the glass that I slipped her
Cause the bitch blacked out and made a dash at the nigga
I held it down then I laughed at the nigga
He came back throwin arms fast like a pitcher
Then I put it on this nigga like a blast from the trigger
Took all the ice and cash from the nigga
Chorus (4x)
Put it on a nigga
Put it on a nigga
Put it on Put it on and shitted on a nigga
Fuck the glitter, im bigga, so why you frontin on a nigga
Only time you know a nigga is when you smokin wit a nigga
I be rappin east and westin so not a question who got the blessin
Buddah, while niggas be smokin my shit like Smiff & Wesson
We put it on a nigga, its the supreme shot liquor
Up in ?cheetas? with your sister about to put it on a nigga
Smoke it out with the mixture then get caught up in a figure
It be Mr. Green layin more dick than Dirt Digler
Make figures, shine bright like God over niggas
I wake up every morning smoke an el wit niggas
With the hydraploric mixture
Do a one hit and quiter
You can be the size of Big Pun my herb will lift ya
The power ????? used to hit my babysitter
I put it on a sister with my dick just past my zipper
I was 5 when I did her
And I'm live when I hit ya
The funk funk shitter to put it on motherfuckers
Chrous(4x)
(Ms. Toi)
Shit what, as I flip what, on a nigga
Niggas better pay me for my verse on my ?spilla?
The pimpa it's miss teasy and you the ????
But if your dick is short than I'm about to call Godzilla
Platinum realeses and new realses sellin my name bigger
Channel live checkin for ???? day my niggas
This ???? and we can negotiate the figures
And possible I'll go with the feat
If it's the realer and dealer and causin casualties from niggas
And my brigade is gonna ride and pistol whip these niggas
And if you got any questions im to a sister
And yes my name is Miss Toi so dont try and play wit her
From coast to coast you know im gonna ride to check the ?milla?
And in the year 2g's be ready for the superheroes
I soacialize and get paid then I can work wit ya
But I put on, shit it on, spit it on niggas

Is It A Dream,One Million Strong,UnKnown,"(Get the flavor, get the loot and let's beat, jet it)
Intro:
What you do when you gotta make paper?
Kill to make a mill then people hate 'cha
Run that game kid before you go like vapor
Get that loot, save that legal shit for later
Verse 1:
If money is the issue
I'm rippin you like tissue
Paper inspires the caper
Drape ya like curtains, hurtin in the individual
Cos life in America's about residual
Interest like my rhyme, Rolex says the time
Stack enough loot can legalise my crime
Like Don Corleone I'm on my way to Rome
Not to rock the microphone, to make a pick-up
Like April 15th I'm tellin y'all to stick up
Big up to my people, the hustlers in the field
It's about work, network cos it's time the nation build
On the lot, the government distributes drop
The mayor is on the corner so y'know we never stops
Like pretty women rollin on my tip
I'm more than a player, I take the coin and flip
My own destiny reads G and my grip slip
To the car dealership where friends
Do stacks full of Benz, co-sign for the Benz
Deep-dish rims is how I be spinnin
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
Chorus:
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
What you do, what you make, what you drive, how you livin????
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
What you smoking, what you drink, why you sniffin???
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
What you wear, who you wit, who honey you be hittin???
Is it a dream or a dream that we be livin?
Where you at, where you from, where's your gun, why you trippin????
Interlude:
(Get the flavor, get the loot....
Get the flavor, get the loot and let's beat, jet it)
*repeat*
Verse 2:
There's always talk about struggle whether you speak it or hustle
The bottom line is get in your piece of life's puzzle
Whether you livin raw right in spite
The first law of nature says you gotta survive another night
Cos I a rules your ways and your actions
Non self-satisfaction, look at Michael Jackson
Caught up in materialistic, you can't shatter
Cos your spirits trapped in a body which is matter
Or should your pockets be fatter
Cos cash rules or are you just a devil's fool
Used like a tool, taxes paid?
I heard a white boy call another white boy ""Yeah nigga, yesterday!""
Cos they slaves to the same beast
Who wants Landcruisers, jeeps, guns, wars, MORE and MORE
I think it's a dream we're living thru deception
Cos '95 is in a reality, it's perception
Chorus
Verse 3:
The loot gets got, pick locks or whatever
I'm too clever to start, heads get severed
From the neck, hold ya cheque, repect nuttin but the green
Credit ain't shit without CREAM, I mean I dream
American dreams caught up in illusion
I gotta get mines, what's the reason for confusion?
Drug-abusin customers praise more ways than bein
A demon for the devil, I run hell with my team and....
What you do when you gotta make paper?
Kill to make a mill then people hate 'cha
Run that game kid before you go like vapor
Get that loot, save that legal shit for later
What you percieve you believe and that's deceivin
That's why they tell you half fake break and keep believin
Believ in self, self-God and you can't be stopped
Got faith in rap and my religion is hip-hop",https://genius.com/Channel-live-is-it-a-dream-lyrics
Wild Out 2K,Armaghetto,2000,"We be the live ones
You dont wanna try son
Cause the rhyme come
Like a nine gun
You can die young
Hide lungs
Til the seventh sign come
Shine son like a diamond
I'm harder than one by one
Flew flicker, Crew licker
Shoot quicker, Loot getta
You can't handle this cause im the truth nigga
The haze puffa, Stage crusher once the wave crush ya
??? while im fuckin ya baby motha
The back of my right mind terror lines
Devil stays higher than the crime rates
At Five Burrous
You spit yo best shit
I spit mines an get arrested
Murder one rhymes killin shit write yo death wish
Well its the herb wanter shotgunner
Hot like summer
Parked like a Hummer
Off the hook like no other
Scale triple stage went from Marcy figga nigga
Bigger than most but still look at where stick up
Dutch smoker, Blunt smoker flippin like a broker
Dope when I pull it quick to draw like poker
Ho getter go getter like my dro wetter
Trunk full of kill we could all smoke together
Chorus 2x:
If you got a hundred dolla bill throw ya hands up
If you ain't afraid to peel throw ya guns up
All my niggas smokin to kill throw ya blunts up
Roll em up, Throw em up

Hey yo we build to destruct with the raw un-cut shit
Us spit rhymes tight like hancuffs get
Niggas say they on some I dont give a fuck shit
Bust chicks, Bust clips
Like they can't get touched with
Well its the party rocka, poon rocka not Silkk Shocker
Put Master the P in an airport locka
Wife, Daughter macka, Behind that ass slappa
We open up the show like niggas typical roster
Niggas can't see us cause they station ain't adjusted
Destined to be burried in gold like King Tut did
Niggas rhymes is ass cause they full of enough shit
Need to bow down an pray while the god touch this
Hey yo fuck lyric for lyric lets go show for show
Give us 45 minutes Channel Live takes all ya doe
We got the live show strap sacks of hydro
Never bring sand to the beach hide ya ho


Dont let the god blast
Here with the math illegal broadcast
Spit something way outta line an make ya car crash
Rhymes comin fast like the first time I saw ass
Make a nigga jaw clash
Tryin to steal my raw ash
Now its the legal broadcast
Lightin it down like calm cash
With the Henny and Bomb Hash
Hot flash, When she let me palm ass
Imma long ass let me hit that ass sprung fast
Hey yo we settin niggas up like when the 3 strikes law passed
Write deep scrpits and prophicies like a the law has
We bringin fire like the cops guns draw fast
Dope rhymes I stop guns like Utah has
Well its all about the ass, cash and last clash
My niggas got flags on poles half mad
For Loumia, Diallo, Rodney King, to my nigga Rallo
If they follow, Hit they ass up like tips hollowed",https://genius.com/Channel-live-wild-out-2k-lyrics
Red Rum (Sign Of The Times),UnKnown,1998,"Evil rules everything around me
Scream! Armageddon blood shedding
Prepare where's your weapon

I stay fly like Tom in Days go by
And die by the God, word eye for an eye
I'm living the American nightmare, it's where
Souls get laid down, sleep without a prayer
It made millionaires off black despair
In a world freezing cold like wars in winter air
They swear God you was born just to go to jail
It got your wiz thinking that you can't exhale
But inhale the hersey
Before Uncle Sam's hands submerse me
Vampires is blood thirsty
Six thousand years curse me, work me, jerk me
My mind reverse G now it's time to reimburse me
I'm robbing devils like the IRS
And repossess in the statue of liberty of death
No matter who you are, where you at or from
When it come, deaf and dumb will be getting served Red Rum
 {x2}
It's a sign of the times
Add on or you die
We stay high like bricks and marija'
As the world burns and the drama grows thicker
Deaf and dumb will be getting served Red Rum

I give my life like crucifixion
But the Christians got my wisdom
Wishing like crack head be fiending on a mission
For the matter
Livest liver
I wonder what's the matter
If religion is what yo practice, different Gods will gather
For the jewels
Fools be wearing Timbos dressed in pink before we sink to the bottom
I'm trying to hit this Brinks
Truck, yo what the fuck do luck
Got to do with the rules
Of laws of nature when you know the bucks moving
If your pocket got a knot, you can rock nonstop
Spot the Glock out the peripheral of your blind spot
Ayo, drop, freeze
Blown away with the breeze
Toking on a bowl trying to make the pain ease
From the hells of Gamora
To the jails of 
Black men getting burnt because the system's out of order
Like the water plus daughter
Sell the pussy for a quarter
If the devil speaks with forked tongue what the fuck's a lawyer?


I can't rest can't sleep
My mind's locked down by the beast, no peace
Police increase
Crime increases it's war
7-24 at your door hit the floor
Truth escape wickedness through the trapdoor
Black life been hardcore since Gettysburg four score
And seven no where to run like Reverend Armageddon
Got my body stressing like pork in your midsection
Making your ears deaf into the lesson
(No struggle no aggression)
No question, no peace with no weapon
Millennium threaten nights I wake cold sweating
Under moon crescents
Days seem like seconds
If life is but a journey this must be a slave ship
In the belly of the demon, screaming, ""I can't take it""
Like a river named Phoenix, is the sun past the zenith
Because the evil flows around like syphilis out the penis
He's a genius like the riddler
(Rather sell out like the fiddler)
Or should I rock the vote when the only choice is Hitler?
Or some cotton picker, pass the ganja not the liquor
Hillary's stuck on my block, somebody might stick her",https://genius.com/Channel-live-red-rum-sign-of-the-times-lyrics
