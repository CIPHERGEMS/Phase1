Come and talk to me, I really wanna meet you girl
I really wanna know your name (Fabolous!)
Whoa, come and talk to me, I really wanna meet, you girl
I really wanna, KNOW YOUR NAAAAAME (Professional 3!)
Oh yeah baby, cause you look so sexy you really turn me on
Blow my mind every time I, see your face girl (Clue!)
You look so sexy you really turn me on
Blow my mind every time I, see your face girl (c'mon!)

So sexy, yeah...
I need to know whatever they call you
Forever I'm loyal, do whatever to spoil you
The way you fit them jeans Seven should call you
That ass had me makin heavy withdrawals
I'm smooth when I approach and I stay on them stones
Make you move in with the coach and leave them players alone
We can talk 'bout it, get a bottle pull the cork out it
One convo' and then you in the condo (c'mon!)

I've been watchin you, for so very long
I'm tryin to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really wanna meet you, but I'm kind of scared
Cause you're the kind of lady, with so much class

I get my thoughts together, for the very next day
But when I see you lately I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk, it really, turns me on
Yeah, oooh you really turn me on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Come and talk to me (my baby)
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you

Ohh, oh oh oh, oh
There you are again, the same smiley, babe
I wanna know just what it is to make you feel this way
I wish I could grab you, tell you what it means to me
See you walkin my way, and it really, makes my day

Before I go to sleep, and dream about you
I'm a single man and I hope that you are, single too (ohh baby)
Tomorrow we'll see, somethin to set my mind free
Cause to you we are so cheap thuggin the, hell outta me
Yeah babe, Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby
 with ad libs

(Professional 3!) Said I wanna know you baby!

See I catch your girl eyes when I play the club
Cause they ain't seen a +Diamond+ dance like this
Since LisaRae in ""The Player's Club""
They might say it's dubs but you see the way it rubs
I always say they must of missed a couple inches boo
I see them heels, you on a couple inches too
Come with me I'll show you what a couple inches do
But first, I was hopin on
We could sit and talk, you know get our Oprah on
Or we could down martinis faster than Lambourghinis
On places where they only wear trunks and bikinis
I don't talk game like a sports commentator
That get you sex now and a court problem later
I rather be real, cause even while havin these mil's
I'm down to earth like gravity still
But you, look, so sexy
You really turn, me on and on and on
And on and on and on... and on and on and on
Yeah

Now I could sit here and call you my honey bun
Beggin' and pleading, and telling you I want some
But that don't fit the Jodeci format
You don't really need that 'cause that ain't where my head's at
Get cozy in my hideout
And if the skins all that, I'll let you know when I slide out
Girlfriend, you know my program
I mean I'm not cock diesel, but I'll be your Conan
Slide to this kid and get comfty
Close the door, dim the lights, press play and then pump me
Pump me like I was a booming system
You told me 'bout your man and how you used to miss him, and...
Notice how I said ""used to""
Now I'll fill gap with a rap you'll get used to
'Cause with me, there's no pressure, no strain
I just want to know your name...

Fantastic Four,The Professional,1998,"Fantastic Four: Cam'ron, Pun, Nore, Canibus

You never hear that we buckle; beef? We chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything I put my money in, gotta see double
Unless y'all wanna see trouble, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Tell you it's crack, then hand a vial ?
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they lick my balls right after I play ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. Hear what I say y'all?O.K. y'all. Ask AJ y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like Stacy Dash, she was eatin' Tracy ass at this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up Desert Storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the Don fall
But I'll come inside The Tunnel, nigga, wit Pope John Paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on Street Soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
Keep 2 bones and 2 phones in each Rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace is all we asking, but I get buck wild like Corey Jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin Nicholi (/nicks), nigga, like Volkof
Know what I mean yo? Notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like El Nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though jumpin outta Lex Coupe
With Jimmy Jones right next to me in the Benz Truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers, I roll wit God, the squad and T.S
Out wit the BS; we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain brolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down with the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the Devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit, now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in back of the Ac
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

Talk about huh? That's what we talk about thug shit

Now what's a symphony, without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My jewels shit on cats without Tiffany
N-O-R-E, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the whip on any street
I fuck wit Clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with Clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' Nore lay pretty low
But them niggas is mos just like the Maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of Chico DeBarge
Thugged Out's 1st lady (let's go half on a baby)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thou on my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ayo, the President is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get head too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, ""go head boo""
Thugged Out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, Cam'Ron and Punisher too
And the beats usually done by Duro and Clue

Who the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign, far from being boring
My style is hard like Castle without McCormick
I run through your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like AIDS cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a Street Fighter like Jean Claude
And I'll split your shit, par
Right down the middle, play you like a fiddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like Monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the Desert Storm annual extravaganza
Crew rolls deeper than the Cartwrights on Bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in Porsches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit, I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of ""cannabis"" that's side-effectless
The type of shit that get the Question-mark Man arrested
Take evasive action, flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on MCs to watch their meat blacken
You try to get fly, you get electrified and fried
And fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me or walk away without a black eye
Word up hops, Clueminat' call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, the cops call SWAT
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the National Guard
Ready or not like the Fugees, crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable, look at what CLUEminati did to you
The maximum lyrical, nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you
Motherfucker... CLUEminati '98

What the Beat,The Professional 2,2001.0,"Niggas is like ""Oh my God not you!""
Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new Tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerrilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, busting yo funky dope maneuvers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the, men of all men I mean the
Creme de la creme a schemer, 
sipping on 'Gnac and Zima
The Professional 2 (DJ Clue!)
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder
Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that!
 
I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many mutherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughing like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body
I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing

My wrist is water and freezer mix
This is Audio Jesus, the repent shit gets big
Keep a sharp-like knife in a pop device
So ""Duro you gotta let it bump!"", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true
I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wilding
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby
, knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me
And they all rich, and still all of their palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words
Clue
, 
Duro
, 
Slim
, 
Meth
Five, Nine
, hold up, breath

It's just, Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do

It's just, Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do

Uhh, uhh, Royce Five-Nine and DJ Clue
I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do

Gettin more press then Elian Gonzalez
Some niggas tell me I'm the hottest
I never cool off
Criticize the shit I write but it's never too soft
Snatch channels like I'm Disney
Half grizzlie unexplain
When niggas see me they duck
Hoppin I pass quickley
Someone to laugh wit me get acquainted
They know exactly when a niggas famous
Or livin dangerous
The kid got a glow like I just came home
Try to dull me
Niggas that owe be hiding from me
Changin their names
Screenin their calls
The dreamcast in the crib
Never leavin at all
Playin NBA 2K for two days straight
Fifty dollas a game
Ket me polish my gain
Withdrawin at the bank
Never deposit a thing
Yo I gotta make a dolla wit slang

Back in the day we was slave
Whips and chains
Its tradition
All I got whips and chains
All I did
Flip some cane
Now a nigga sick of the range
Only a new six could fix the pain
Look at all these goose bumps round my wrist and veins
Milton Bradley wanna get my game
5-0 wanna frisk my frame
I dont deal wit cheap blow
When I shoot no block
Sort of like a free throw
Can't miss
And one of you bitches burn me and I can't piss
Got me itchin like its dandruff
You gone see the back of cam hand quick you dam bitch
Im a stomp you stab you
Look at you you dam bitch
Ya love I would dumb back out
Everybody like ""killa
When u come back out,"" Listen
I like rap
Routine had to stop
Met a new connect got it 18 a whop
Cops on payroll every block got blow
We fight every night
Reunite then pop Moe
Thats how it is when you deal wit me
And I dont feel tv
Only real tv
Real money real gats real cats real girls
MTV I'll show you the real world
Cats run up on you
Splatter your white eyes
Thats only to make saturday night live
Lookin for a casket got the right size
Wanna bake a cake I got the right pies
Crashed up the four
But now the right five
Lookin for beef you found the right guys
Old folk say ""cam stop ur route
Why you gotta get the guns, just box it out""
Listen, that there is strife, only fightin' is the doctor
And that's for your life
As for your wife
Took her out just to tour town
Bench press for what, I lift four pounds
Tear up your car
All four doors down
Cats wanna box, well here's four more rounds

Yo
Keep talkin bout convertibles and your ice
I'mma smack you yap you and murder you
Keep talkin bout your dawgs is this
And you leavin out the part that your dawgs is bitch
Lets get straight to the point
Ain't a nigga better than me
Im aggravated and im fed to the T
If I gotta do joints
And I'm sittin for five
When you remeniss about me
Say the nigga was live
I got twelve arm robberies pendin
A dope charge, a gun charge
Hard to see holiday bendin
Wit a brand new case
Twenty niggas, the ride
A spot OT
And some brand new base
Why say names
You could get who ever you know
I got the gun cocked
Ready to blow
Dont compare his rhymes to mines
Mines is real
And his is just words and lines

Now I'mma give it to you straight cause I don't cop no pleas
Sheek Lush, a nigga who got lots of cheese
Wit enough coke to stand on and slide like ski's
And you could see your whole body on my H-R vreethe
How you wanna do this shit
Like the quick and the dead
So I could cock back
Empty out the back of your head
Do a drive-by go head
Im quick wit the heater
I shoot through you
Your car
And through the parkin meter

Look it ain't much to talk about, fuck you
Fuck where you from, you better wear your gun
Won't shoot nothin, but you will appear in court
I put your brains everywhere so you could share your thoughts
Few hot shells outta the chrome will leave you there
Wit a funny smell like gun powder colon
Listen everythings about the kiss
The new dope out
Sky blue CL 6 with the new poke-outs
Tired of the speculation faggit
Everything is real here
Ya ain't gonna get wreck on jason
Hold down the fort
Could never be baught
So I dont flip when the crackers wave checks in my facin
Rather start gunnin
Cause soon as you start chasin' the money, that's when the money start runnin'
I drive by in a car service
Hope out wit mad nigga
Pull my phone out
Like ya nervous

Like ya don't know the kid stay hittin benches
Wit kay's of the cane
Leave strays sittin' inches away from your brain
In them grey kitted benzes, I sway threw the lanes
Now the nay's just sit and flinches, when they see the chain
Ya might not never come out, my verses get heard
I'm a hustler, I don't sleep from the first to the third
Take a while to load the Cali, but the shots go quickly
Put red spots on your neck and they not no hickeys
The truck still got those micky's
And don't even pass it my way if it's not no sticky
No matter where I'm at I pop regardless
'Cause I get knocked, I cut a check, ya gone drop the charges
Put three holes in head, make 'em look like bowlin' balls
Come through in spring with Nikes that don't get sold 'til Fall
So I could hardly care
'Cause the only way I see time behind bars, if it's a Cartier

And get the camcorder to cam-cord their hand movements
And for what? Y'all actin' like y'all better than Hov'
Y'all niggas should open up for the Letterman show

Let this nigga run around untied
I swear to god
You know the type that talk wild, but nigga's white cloud
Soft as a baby's bottom, you know Jay Z spot him
Haven't heard him in a while, and you know how come?
This little faggot in the corner dialing 911
Snatched the phone, get a grip dog you 'posed to be thug
What you telling the cop huh? I'm taking your money and drugs
In the underworld we take care of beef ourself
And another thing yo we police ourself
Either you follow the codes or you sell cocaine
This life will swallow you whole so get outta the game
Go to church every Sunday and pray hard
And drug dealer? (haha) don't quit your day job
(Hook)

(Ja Rule)
Nigga who else
Pop guns and rap jewels
Mean while
Burning in hell child
We the center of attention
Show me love for my nigga blazing
My niggas is made men
Gangsters shit get coke and sugar boes
Got hoes for every home
And never fuck they own
Even though the Fed's got a sweating grip in the chrome
Commuter case is closed they tapping' the telephone
Dialing' a 213 zone now
Got ?? slap a bitch up and send her down
Felling me, I wanna put this hustle behind me
But every time I look away he's hitting me blindly
I'm looking for the light baby
And here it is
As soon as the nigga smiling
Darker the night gets
That's why we Gangster and you players
Take 2 to the heart Inc
World most murderous

I thought Duro was an old man before I met her
Check this out right, this is me M-A dollar sign E (C'mon, C'mon)
Thorough,too throrough, Harlem World be the burough
Cool 'da Love up above (that's right)

Mase too smooth, call me debonair
Hits every year, so shake your derriere (C'mon)
Cops pull me over, what they don't feel it fair
What a brother, too black, me living here
We don't stare, I don't care, I'm know I'm there
Twenty years old and about to be a millionaire
What you think, cause Mase be young, Mase be dumb
And if you get Mase strung, that'll be no pre-nup
Ever since Big died, my whole life changed
I done blew, I'm your boo, it seem quite strange
I get nice things, way out your price range
Half these girls, don't even know my right name
I'm fly rolie, mink made of coyote
Love a ghetto ho, I know she die fo' me
You got me confused, see Cam the freak
Mase never the the nigga to bring sand to the beach
I some that an average ho's hand couldn't reach
Living in expenses, 20 grand a week
You know me, I be O-T,low-key
Icy roli, smoke a O-z
I'm a baby face nigga, without no goatee
And I'm 2.8 and about to blow 3

If you was hot, you'd be going through the cell I do
Give alias to any female, I screw
One running with Fabolous,who knew as well as I do
Every fed in the country wanna nail my crew
Before I hit the tens, I'm getting bailed by crew
Be back downtown,bagging chicks at L-I-U
Cause money ain't a thing no more, I use to sling the raw
Now I'm off in spring to tour, in Singapore
Might catch me getting head from a bilingual whore
Who never seen so many diamonds in her ring before
I'm a boasting fly bro, soon to lay on a coast of Cairo
Roast the hydro, type of cat you would say, is supposed to lie low
And V two shades with the toast and the Tahoe
We the niggas when it get nippy, throwing minks on
Cubans to the belly,and still throwing links on
Ya'll cats know me, I be throwing clinks on
And be loving the bitches, we be throwing drinks on

Did you know that I, simply got these cats where I want 'em and...

It ain't a secret, bet that I slide 'em with something I could freak with
And do that freak shit
And I'm stepping in hotter, like Don Dada
Snatch my Prada, ya hoes done done nada
Make you never wanna flash your shit
Like when you see my crew you wanna stash your shit
If dude violate, then I will crash your shit
If you think you was a'ight, I will blast your shit
Ya know me, chick that ride the dick slowly
Use to be O-T, now I'm 2.3 (Uh)
Same bitch that ya'll loving to hate
Be that same chick, that you praying will flake
And I solemnly swear, we'll rep to the death
Ya heard?(uh,uh,uh)Fuck you think this is?
If you broke, then I be off, do mine, ski off
And, ain't no love, just trying to get my thing off
Unless there's some princesses on the wrist
Or some chrome on the 6, he ain't seeing my shit
Oh yeah, it's not a game, I do my thing

In the hood sellin' rocks, never thought I would see it through
I was just a hood nigga sellin' crack with deflated hoop dreams
You can't see it by the way the Bentley coupe bling (ha ha!)
I'm fresh out, just tryna keep my shoes clean
While you on TV doin' your 1, 2 thing
On BET sittin' by Free in them blue jeans
Is the reason I waited for you like true fiends
Fast-forward, relationship in full-swing
News headlines read ""Game Got A New Fling""
I got a new queen
And after what happened at Hot 97 it's time for a new team
Get Jacob on the phone, cop some new bling
Can't be affiliated if he snitched on
This Rap shit'll leave you scarred
And through it all, you are my ghetto superstar

Real talk, my faith would deter me (ahh)
Seven days, my heart's still burnin'

It's funny what seven days could change
From the ""Dreams"" video to a box at the Wizards' game
I give my heart, my house, & this chain
Just to see ya face when the roses came
You wanted me to meet ya family - I'm on the next plane
To eat dinner with ya pops at P.F. Changs
He said he would die for you I told him I'd do the same
And I seen it in his eyes - he could feel my pain
I told you I had a son - you wanted to know his name
Harlem, but the fans call him ""Baby Game""
For his birth I was against all odds in the streets
Me, Little Mike, & Fase dodgin' police
Now we in the studio - heads bobbin' to beats
First Jay & Beyonce then Nas & Kelis

We in DC eatin' chicken on a college bench
To my condo in L.A., slap-box, I'm with
Daddy's lil' girl, makin' people Glock and a whip
Now is it that irate that a nigga could relate
To us holdin' each other down on our first date?
You remind me of my nigga, ridin' state to state

You made yours singin' - I made mine off weight

I'm about to expose these young dudes identity
I'm still slick with the tongue
Quick wit a gun
Give back to whoever I'm as real as they come
Muah is amongst the apprentices
And these little dudes is just playing with sentences
The diffrences is
They do it for less
I do it for best
How many live niggas you know that can do it to death yes
Life is a bitch and I came in it
Similar to melo when comes to the game winners
Whatever duke
We can lock up or slug it out
You would be amazed how we just thug it out what!!!!

Can hit my target with a slug I'm hawk it
The way the bullets come out the thompson is awkward
I understand spanish much better than I talk it (vato)
I'm always down bottom but I stay on some New York Shit
Right now the budget is real tight
Ijust might
I feel like like I can drop whenever I feel like
Screw what the odds is
The boy got the artful dogers sitting on top of the nik boots marvlous
Compare me to nothing around  in town
Unless it's the 2 up in there air or under the  ground
25 357's all chrome heads
Baseball gloves the champoin hoodies the conehead
Me I get the loot and route before I have to shoot it out
My flows like a needle right before you get a rootcanal
We the one's locking up slug it out show you what a thug about
It's a damn shame how we thug it out


Took care of my business with diddy
Now I'm waiting for the ryders and jimmy to slide me a couple of pennies
Something mean from the phillipines on my chest and
Catching NCAA in high-def'n
I don't have a problem with squeezin a quarter
Or getting a liter of water just to finish the order
Screw 5 months with no d's we can flood it out
I know what exactly want me to do is thug it out

Put ya hoodie on just thug it on out
ACG boots thug it on out
Let ya pants sag just thug it on out

Load up the 80's cause cop killin Queens is crazy

Never turn your back on a nigga you don't trust
Never turn your gat on a nigga and don't bust
Never expect to get away with the same shit -- more than twice
Never forget you could get it too for a price
Never bring it to a nigga, if you scared to die
Never gonna do it nigga, if you scared to try
Never gonna be another day it gets dark, nigga
Never get it fucked up, that shit here, for the heart nigga
Never say never, cuz I never thought this clever thought never
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with three letters, DMX!

Woof! Can't spell the west without the ""es.""
DJ Clue. Beyotch! Kurupt!

I fall off into a party with a drink in my hand
Rocawear pants, but I ain't come here to dance
By any chance, has anybody seen DJ Clue?
Tell him I'm lookin' for him (What's yo' name?) Big Snoop
I'm in the big Coupe, I got that whoop whoop
I'm tryin' to get a chicken, I got that big loot
Let me slide to the hoop, regroup, and come through
I'll bag it up, and serve you and you too
I throw strikes like Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens
Pitch a shut-out, the whole 9 innings
The bulletproof 'Lac with the windows tinted?
You mean the one with the pretty bitches sittin in it?
Please believe it, we gon' represent it
And we gon' bend it and dent it
Fuck what it cost, we gon' spend it
Buy it, never rent it
Now when you suckin my dick, baby girl put yo' face in it
Get it get it girl (get it girl), make yo' head swirl
Get it get it (get it girl), make my toes curl
And get it get it, go on girl, it's a crazy mixed up doggy dogg world

And I know that you really can't believe what ya hear and ya see
Just put ya hands up and repeat after me
Get yo' money, fuck a bitch...and blow a gang of weed
And I know that you probably never thought that you could see a true G
A nigga like the D-O-double Gizzy
But like I said, get yo' money, fuck a bitch, and blow a gang of weed

Yeah, yall the type of suckers we straight through
When we skate through, with DJ Clue
Hoes gobble on something, swallow on something
Throwin' hollows like football passes and football practice
Off that dodo, look at the shine comin' off that fo' fo'
I want the ki's, the trees, the ice, and the g's
What's yours is mines, but you already know though
I'm young gotti desodo
Let's see how long a body can flow fo'
I got my Rocawear leather on, on swoop nigga
You know Dame and Jigga laced me and Snoop nigga
Them my motherfuckin' homeboys
See Beanie's from my hometown
 Memphis with the full pound
Tucked in Amil purse, all you bitches hatin' get a deal first
It's hard work, raise off the homegirl bitches
Chorus
Yeah, you know how we do
Big Snoop Dogg, Kurupt Young Gotti
Rockin these niggas. Rocafella, what?!? Fuckers!
Iceberg Slimmin' on these hoes. Doin it big
Aight aight, I'mma take me a trip to Marcy, go fuck with my OG's
And fuck you bitches and you bitch ass niggas

I got Montana nines more tangled lines
Who wanna wine and dine with Bris get in line
I fight like I rhyme niggas thirsty to shine
Can't jack mine
I'm one of a kind

Die slow y'all niggas is dust like pyro
You sleep with your eyes close
Might as well be blind fold
See how much my nine hold blast my one
Dos tres to the cuatro cinco
Reload bitch

How you want it
Head or gut
You soft like baby butt (I like that)

Their jewels they tuck

Intimidated how we hop out the truck
Or the S type Jag
Y'all niggas straight fag

Ridin round town with gun in masses
Copped out the ten years but only had six
All the ghetto hoods with only one bad bitch

This is for my bitches who ain't never have shit

Love cats with Roleys and Carti glasses
Nasty hoes who take it in they asses

I ain't gotta tell y'all niggas where I'm from
I ain't never tell no bitch when I cum
I'm far from a lame you will never see me run
You know how we do it beef jump into it
M.A.F.I.A.'s the gang max out the squadron
Nine millimeter team

Who said we ain't rich
Kim's bling cost a fortune
Queen Bee niggas shootin anything crawlin
From now on it's on when I catch you niggas snorin
Any fresh event you can bet niggas sportin
Betta leave town catch a flight in the mornin
Get the cold out ya eyes somebody bout to die
Three niggas got beef three niggas got to go
Hit em all in the row like tic tac toe

That you might've mistaked a nigga for a chauffeur
Ya might mistake that backseat for a sofur (sofa)
Now the dreads said to rap on everything
Cause he know that I snap on everything
Listen, when my flow commissions
It caused the commissioner to throw a cap on everything

If I get the crib on the side of the mountain
Right beside the fountain
And decide on the Phantom
I'll go broker than Hammer

Snow, rain, sleet, get it together, christmas in leather
I smell suckers here, your wife, I corrupt her ears

Jacuzzi, elevator, maid, two chefs
Gang on my hyph, Funk Flex, 100 2-steps
I go to people who can't hear with two breaths
And Russel Simmons and ask 'em all, who's deaf?
I been on the block since '90, who left
O.G.'s or old keys, living legend, true vet
I sell dope, sling crack, move X
Ex's, hallways, always, who's next
The chain is chunky too, color is Sunny Dew
Funky monkey, monkey see, monkey do

Once again it's on

Put your middle fingers up
Get your middle fingers moving

But mami, teeth fucked up, tell her fix her grill
Can't afford it, whoa, go get some bills
Suck my dick, no, not a lick until
No homo, this time lick and seal
My backyard Sea World, I got fish and seals
I'm just that deal, I would pitch and deal
Mission still with the steel, whatever not to miss a meal
Here come the frisk and feel
Put my wrist and steal
Before I leave, blow my weed on this biscuit steel

Fantastic Four: Cam'ron, Pun, Nore, Canibus

You never hear that we buckle; beef? We chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the Hen Rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. Hear what I say y'all?
O.K. y'all. Ask AJ y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like Stacy, damn, she was eatin' Tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up Desert Storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the Don fall
But I'll come inside The Tunnel, nigga, wit Pope John Paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on Street Soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep 2 bones and 2 phones in each Rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to Lorey Actins, but I get buck wild like Corey Jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin Nicholi (/nicks), nigga, like Volkof
Know what I mean yo? Notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like El Nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta Lex Coupe
With Jimmy Jones right next to me in the Benz Truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers, I roll wit God, the squad and T.S
Out wit the BS; we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drownin with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down with the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit, now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the Ac
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than Kung Fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

Talk about huh? That's what we talk about thug shit 
Now it's a symphony, without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without Tiffany
N-O-R-E, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit Clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with Clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' Nore lay pretty low
But them niggas is mos like the Maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of Chico DeBarge
Thugged Out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thou on my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the President is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, ""go head boo""
Thugged Out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, Cam'Ron and Punisher too
And the beats are usually done by Duro and Clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign, far from being borin
My style is hard like cancer without McCorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like AIDS cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a Street Fighter like Jean Claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like Monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the Desert Storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on Bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in Porsches
Can't be tested or F'ed wit, I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of Canibus (/cannabis) that's side-effectless
The type of shit that get the Question-mark Man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on MCs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, CLUEminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call SWAT
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the National Guard
Ready or not like the Fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what CLUEminati did to you
The maximum lyrical, nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you
Motherfucker... CLUEminati ninety-eight

I blast off on the track, lord
My shit is pure satisfaction, what more could you ask for
Wit facts like an ?ansaw?, I pour fire on earth, I been to hot raw
Do Queens tires get burnt, let's peel through the real
Slide through my terrain, take a ride wit me
Check out my lifestyle, it's a off-road course
I stay challenged, but that's a good thing
Cuz it creates balance, Infamous wild life federation
My congress, sit down and conversate ya fate
Derate barracks, don't get yourself embarrassed

Start hoppin, cuz when it's on we ain't stoppin
The click'll get the message when shit start droppin
Don't got a gat stashed, you better start coppin

Now you can talk about a nigga, criticize my faults
But in New York, got it locked wit bolts, blow the vote
Overdose, while you cop block and cut throats
Me and my click's champagning, and campaigning
While you rhyme about your jewels, and sniff that shit up in your nostrils
I'll be plottin on your life, to put one up in your fossil
Niggas think they gully, on the inside sweet like honey
Niggas want the bitches, we just want the money
Federal notes, flipped blue, keys of coke store frontin watchin his dough
Tourin the coast, pardon wife due, gettin babies drunk
Call me foul, deep down, you gotta admit, you like my style
Put holes in your Polo, I know your M-O, you half homo
Joinin my team, that's a no-no
Say what you want, don't let it talk for you
And that's my word, I'll have this hollow tip stored for you
Chorus 2x

One time nigga, two times nigga yo
I dig the way Clueminatti got the beats rollin through the body
The type of tracks, got me killin these cats
Twenty-one and black, mental inner city minds be exact
When niggas in the hood ain't no good, carry gats
And leave you on your back in a hurry
Especially, dealin wit the money
Rockin Pelle fuckin wit the Spanish mami cheffin up by dellis
Now we got the guns pumpin jums out the back of a deli
Really, these chumps gettin slummed on the daily
Forty days, forty weeks, either these raps are back in the streets
Stackin cracks up in the fleece, so Hav blaze the bees
And pass that to me, and I'll bless piece
So this way the whole fam eat
Be the Infamous of this shit, pioneers of this
Survival of the Fittest, nobody's fuckin wit this
So fuck around wit Hav, you fuck around wit me
You fuck around wit me, then you fuck around wit P
You fuck around wit us, then you fuck around wit three

Dudes come in heavy but they leave out light homie
Married to robberies, leave you holy in matrimony
He leavin' out the club, security 'round him
Chick you ain't thinkin' bout that when your stomach is growlin' (hell no)
I can taste it so bad, my heart is poundin'
Thinkin' if I get this nigga, be a couple of thousand
Told my dude, follow his whip make sure you don't lose him
Almost got caught at the light, run that, you stupid?
I got an eye for this shit and I don't need no specs
Cause I can see the ice glisten through that 5 percent
So I stop at a Delhi, prolly 'fford some dutches
'bout to creep till' Jake pulled up, them muthafuckas
Nervous a little somethin', but that shit wore off
Yeh right about that time, the Jake peeled off

And super on point for the peoples
The bells, the police bitch
And if I go broke I'll be doin' this more often
The rings and the wristwatch
Before I put your brains in the coffin


Ain't no use in tuckin' that chain (it's too late nigga)
Cause I can see in the spot, you was mister bling bling
Yeh, the wheels of motion it done been arranged
And I'm just waitin' for that ass to hop up in that range
Put a bad bitch on him, all he thinkin' is pussy
See, dudes want the honey all we want is the goodies
2 way back and forth on 2 cars back
Ain't nobody tryina that recognize this fucked up act
Know a nigga waitin' patient, shorty hit me back
She know I got caught at the light, told me where to catch up
I gotta get this muhthafucka so I'm doin' a buck
Better slow the fuck down 'fore I get locked up
Told her take him to a parking lot, one in the cut
It might look a little fishy but niggas wanna nut
Hurry up, got there 'fore the windows fogged up
Opened up the door, nigga give tha-at up

With stash boxes, and niggas in it saying blast Nas shit
Drove down harm's way, puffing that Bombay

Names of my fam, so I'mma read you a scripture
And commandments to get you richer
Bandannas, hammers, MAC's and NINA's
With the mismatched Pumas, like Shan in Queensbridge
All white shell toes, that's that Queens thing
Breitling, ice wine, call that weed sling
Know where G slang
And the bitches with bomb ass that slurp on me and my comrades
Got a new contract, come on, black
Shit y'all just getting up on, I'm beyond that
No time for crumbs, I really don't see them
They just started living, just started having threesomes
Just started having girls who like them

Now this is what I act like when I smoke on black
Stay high wit the lazy-eye, bomb wit facts
From the, street Bible or the street Quran
Fake thugs ride the dick when my shit comes on
I'm a nappy little nigga, still goin strong
You can eat a dick while I eat a thong (CLUE!)
But still the bomb

It's the wave-king, rock the two tone Wallees strip-ons
Don't wanna end up miss-on, then play your positi-on
My grimy Brooklyn niggas stay flippin ya chick
While my crew from New Jerus stay vickin ya whips
Tek is the shit, ain't nobody spittin like this
Deep impact steez been like a chromed out six
Wit the AMG kit, Ericsson wit the chip
Y'all stockin-cap copy-cats, get off the dick
I keep the livin quarter held down wit two nines
One in the bed, one in the bathroom at all times
So while I'm takin a shit, I'm at route and plan a hit
The amount we flip depends on what we get
It's like a Wall Street trick, dirty money move quick
My mans wear stones you can tip the scales wit
On they ears and wrists alone for every deaf one's bone
Look, ain't no tellin how many gats I've thrown
 (Steele)
Come on (yo for all my dogs gettin wild)
Come on (yo yo for all the shorties on the prowl)
Come on (yo yo for all the soldiers on the streets)
Come on (yo yo it's yo' time to eat)

Yo the set I claim is the set that bang
To the muthafuckin end, I be doin my thing (YEAH!)
Lidu Rock, know the name in New York we G stackin
First the Bloods and the Crips, now bitches is carjackin
Like my nigga Craig and em say, ""Fuck that shit!""
Rockin shines in the 'Ville, you better tuck that shit
Or watch yo' step baby, watch where you walk
I put a slug up in yo' mouth so that ass won't talk
For real son, now we got mad cops on the block
Cuz we hold it down for Doc and I keep my heat cocked
Lidu Rock, what the fuck I know y'all niggas mad at me
So if you rep for yours go 'head take a stab at me, muthafucker

You a many style copy-cat, ?bendy mile? stockin cap
Fake nigga from the projects who ain't got a gat
Ruck reign supreme, aim the steam
When the gun click, your ass shit navy beans
Maybe these, niggas ain't ready for the Magnum
Force, the Holocaust, balls I just dragged them
Off lost in the sauce and of course I'm glad them
Monkey niggas don't fuck wit the Ruck cuz they fags, son
The last one, to step to Sean P caught a bad one
Quincy toes tagged em after somebody stabbed em
Cornball niggas wit drugs thinkin they weight great
Still bummin money for stoges and a Drakes cake

Get it straight, y'all niggas fuckin wit some heavyweights
Boot Camp-ion champions on point like paper mates
Demonstrate, spectacular venacular
Smackin ya upside the back of ya head wit a spatula
Snatchin ya, off the street like police
Next week, they find your body washin up on the beach
Don't speak if you ain't at norm (ain't got nuttin to say fool)
Tally on, be gone, as we rally strong
See me in Brook-lyn where crooks be armed
Terrorial disputes leave you in memorial suites
Callin your troops, I shoot straight stay in ya place
We the type you love to hate cuz we stay in your face
Sayin our grace before we put our hands in our plates
Carnivorous lyricist, niggas fish like fillet
My mind spray like a murderer's nine spray
The crime way, get mine three-hundred sixty-five day

Trying to tell you man
I'm going up in there
Trying to dig into niggas pockets
Fuck that man

Either you be real or you be dead
Hey killer, be a killer
That's the rules to this game
In the court of the law
With let niggas that feel ya
They know cat dealers
But with some new shit, like Clue shit
We strap for this thriller
You hit the crack house, you pull a mack out
Cock the mack back, blow his back out
And take the back route
And that's what that's about
Understand? I wan't cans in hand
This shit is real, never phony
Don't come short with my mo-ney
I'll only tell you once Tony
""Don't fuck me, don't you ever try to fuck me""
If so, trust me, you outta luck B
And try to sit high where them drugs be
Filthy rich looking broke
Fuck a bitch I wan't the world thust
Keeping feds of my ass
I gotta think fast
'Cause black man white town you know this shit won't last
We try to bumble like ass
Stay low, got to hurl that cash
Into the trouble blow past, that's how you do it
Chorus:
We got cops and robbers
Niggas and spicks
Flashy cars, ghetto stars
Moving stones and bricks
It ain't over on the streets
We got blocks to get
So heads up, guns cock
Don't get rocked to this

-{Lord Tariq}-
Now if the good die young
Then what the fuck that makes me?
And who the fuck are you to rape me?
Less then the best, bulletproof love
The thugs holding it down in the decks
And for the frauds I got techs
Heading straight for your chest
Feel me on this
My word is priceless
You can't pawn this
I might diss drop jewels
The way I cop jewels
The way my nine drops flues
The way my mind influes
What's a nigga to do a murder
Type of shit you never heard of
]From jimbos to fat burger
On some last long shit
I be doing this forever like that nigga Von Zeil
Plus I calm shit, I bomb shit
I had alot of Brooklyn niggas
Saying ""Yeah them Bronx niggas they get down""
So hold your heat up, and move fast
You got to keep
Because Clue, Minnesota, Lord Tariq run these streets what
Nigga peep up, talking to the sidewalk
And there's nothing to comprehend
When my nine talks
Chorus(2X)
-{Muggs}-
I peep the devil screaming BK cause I rock for B.I.G
Live like 'Pac' did, shells couldn't stop the kid
In some rap I pack, used to be in passing for crack
Molka type of lid with a passing for stacks
Dreads call me African Black named after my medicine
Street veteran with one gun
Killed eleven men
It's too crazy, y'all fake tough guys with full gazi's
Blue mercedes, three pounds under the blue avy
Bomb crews my mind power beyond you
Now I push your hair line back
Do what the con do
I warned you, and sworn no talking
Bring the thing out
Got the block surrounded like cops
And shots rang out
Animal instinct, blood type is therobreed
Run with thero heads
Leave you in another burough bed
Respect my hood, like the heats do
Be k to the Bronx

Fuck who you and your man go get
Me and cat take +Pussy's+ on boat rides on some Soprano shit
Move wit troops in cougar coupes
Like beeno and notes for a G a piece, they'll remove your roof
Ya better spread when the ruger shoot
Paul Cane got fire, everything ya heard on Clue was the truth
It's like who want what what ever
Tou and your man play tough ya gon get plucked together
At gun point gettin stuck together
Black Benz tinted out, buggy headlights stuck together

So play dumb in these dum dups

Stick you for your lump sums

Till the day my lungs done for blocks
I hit hard like Ronnie Lotts
Lady Luck got it locked


Ya talkin greasy like Paul ain't a nigga wit fire
Like I ain't got guns or killers for hire
Got wolves that'll run through mask and arms
Like point break clear the safe out and smash your moms
Over 40 years old still blastin chrome
Smiles never cross they face till there's cash in palm
Cause they still do murders for bucks
Gave em put hollow points through you then pass the burner to Luck
We like a 2 G Bonnie and Clyde, back to back in beef
Wit two heats a piece, mami gon' ryde
Spit four, she behind me wit five

Is for my peoples in the streets, Swizz Beats
And this thing right here Ruff Ryders
Will get your ass off your feet, remix, c'mon
They call me, 'Drag On' when it's time to bomb
I burn 'em all till they all say turn 'em off
'Cuz these chips I'ma run 'em all chickenheads
Know I be the Colonel 'cuz I burn eternal mixed wit the inferno
So be careful, 'fore I burn you you better learn dude, yeah I heard you
But I'ma hurt you, but you don't know, my versatile is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which means a lot cream, lot of schemes
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man 'cuz I'm too tough indubitably, too dust
Do you bust? 'Cuz we do you need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently, is you buying this?
'Cuz niggas that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag On, I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkers
But this Bronx bomber's spittin' flame
So you better wear your armor flame on
My dogs gon' stop, your dogs gon' drop
And then we gon' shut 'em down, open up shop
First we had em like ohh, now they like no
What baby? That's how Ruff Ryders roll
My dogs gon' stop, your dogs gon' drop
And then we gon' shut 'em down, open up shop
First we had em like ohh, now they like no
What baby? That's how Ruff Ryders roll
When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my Glock up
You know what I'm about, slidin' off get my cock sucked
Or writin' rhymes watchin' Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out?
If you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides, 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
Then give it to a modelin' bitch
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time
Y'all niggas ain't hearin' me out, til I pop up
Appear in your house, clearin' it out, holiday style
Everybody actin' violent and wild
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin' the clip and the clip's only helpin' my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin' your man?
When I cock back and hop out the van
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, it's natural
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge
Guess you figured that my niggas, flippers, pullin' triggers
News team crowd around, tryin' to flick a picture
Get witcha, this bitch from Illadelph marches quicker
Nigga not makin' sense better stay up off the liquor
Blonde bombshell, caramel, heavy spender
Groups be sayin' I'm they sister, hush ya mouth 'fore I hit ya
Stickin' in wiseguys, fake thugs and bullshitters
Take you for a ride, cover up your eye, then I get ya
Used to be shyer, now I'ma Ruff Ryder
Big niggas play me close, when they used to ride by her
Snatchin' up your figures, frontin', know you dig us

And then we gon' shut 'em down, open up shop
First we had em like ohh, now they like no

Outta sixteen shots I'ma hit, which one of you niggas am I gonna get
Thought you knew what I was gonna spit, this time with this rhyme
But by the end of it, y'all niggas is gon' be like, ""Yo X ripped it""
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop

Plenty y'all wit his chest out gettin stocked up
We trade war stories back on the streets
When we played em messhall

Dedicated to these streets a pump valve little nigga

When he saw the black kron
I thought the nigga wore a thong
The way he froze his arm
Dukes said its on
He stripped to his drawers when he heard one raw
Took off half ass when the nigga spit more
And we all spit game you niggas ?heard free? game
By soft motherfuckers, you lame mothefuckers
I fall, I get back
To test my worth
I tell heads to hit that, its raw get rid of that
My worker take thirty off a bundle
Dodging the bikers, and'em D's
When they rush the jungle
So we stash in the fences
Sit low on the benches
Keep a small gun in case its on in the trenches

It's best that thee put on the bets wit' me
And testin' me? I hit your chest wit' three
Let's make it clear that we gon' take it there
The way it appears, there ain't a club shakin' rears

With the thickest chips, and the quickest whip

Yeah, DJ Clue?
To all the killers and the hundred-dollar billers
Ha-ha, to real niggas who ain't go no feelings
Check it out now, yeah
[You got to fuck with my realness
I'm sick with it like I'm stuck with a illness
It ain't luck that I'm still rich
Just more reason for me to tuck and conceal this
Your boy might have to hit a fuck-nigga kill switch
Snap right back to me standin' in the projects
Bakin' soda, (?) handin' me the Pyrex
We was small then, but the plan was to be 5x
The world is yours plan, but, man, I need that Nas Lex
SC 400, that's all your boy wanted
And the light-skinned shorty from next door that's frontin'
She couldn't see that I was that next boy or somethin'
Maybe I just needed to flex more or somethin'
Now I hit that fuckin' Rolex store for nothin'
And I could teach niggas, give lectures on stuntin'
And if I need a bitch, I could text yours or somethin'
Then she don't see me the next tour tour or somethin'
Chick crazy right, imagine me when I was twenty-three
Ridin' through Brooklyn, realizin' it's only one of me
Notice that I'm who the wannabes want to be
It feelin' like all of y'all don't want none of me
In this kitchen, step back and watch the chef cook
My corner told me, ""Counter jabs with a left hook""
And give me mine, you don't want to see my stress look
I drive through with the mask, lookin' like Westbrook
Cash me out, for the twenty Gs I'm in there
Now multiply it by how many times I been here
Forty Gs for the show with the in-ears
Dog, I ain't hit a ATM in ten years
There's a difference in gettin' money and got money
I'm just a winner with a pocket full of pot money
I ain't judgin', baby, go and get that (?) money
You better stay for a rainy day when it's not sunny
You know niggas change just like the weather
Get in one argument and just like, ""Whatever""
Meet a new bitch who look just whoever
People sayin', ""Wasn't they just, like, together?""
My bitch ass feel so soft just like my leather
Got a good head on her, I just like 'em clever
This life forever, fuck the lame, mad shit
You wouldn't look this good in the same-ass fit
I'll give it to you niggas on some AIM Blast shit
Then give it to your sons on some Dame Dash shit, boy
You niggas ain't bosses anyway
A nine-to-five beat a tender life any day
Get your money cause ain't no thing as halfway crooks
You scared to death, you scared to look
You shook cause ain't no thing as halfway crooks
You scared to death, you scared to look
You shook cause ain't no thing as halfway crooks
You scared to death, you scared to look
You shook cause ain't no thing as halfway crooks",https://genius.com/Dj-clue-fiesta-freestyle-feat-jadakiss-and-sty-lyrics

Get out of here I'm the bouncer here tonight

Your boys are out numbered so plan tomorrow
While I do the wild thing like I'm Sam Lombardo
My crew is grimy enough to ride in cargo
Cause brick city beef with more people than y'all bro
(A yo dogg what up)
Yo the cold is coming
So I be up all night like my toilet runnin'
As a little boy was know for spoiling somethin'
Now it's like fuck you
It will be brawl or nothing
(Hit the streets 4 in the morning)
To run you over
The beef we love the steam and cooked in okra
Bitchs in the bricks slit the throats of both ya'
Walk on T.V live hooking off on Opera
I ain't buff but got nough' muscle to fight
I ain't a dog but got enough hustle tonight
Here's the facts to you punks
And the message is
When you buy guns invest in extra clips
Ahhhhhhh!

When he went inside the club I flattened his wheels
DUI drug addict and I'm back at the wheel
You happened to feel
This amphibian rappish and back at the gills
From back at the hill (chill, chill, chill)
It's me on the nine to nine
Crashed it
Now my sores on the eye-a-dine
Po po found the dro but no firearm
Cause I look shady like sun visor blind
Dangerous I leave a smell
That's why the sign read ""Don't feed the whale""
Doc like +Adabisi+, ""I need the bail""
Cause I keep my weed locked in the +OZ+ as well
Yo what I look like a kid to you?
I'm like +Bishop+ gunnin' down my friends in +Juice+
Brick dogg and I'm out to defend my food
So fuck the media with the middle two (two , two , two)

Now just through your hands up in the motherfuckin' sky
Da dirt always bubble pour peroxide
You see? Thought I lied
Nah dogg the truth
I submarine out like my car waterproof
You niggas break day and still y'all broke
You minus well get a job use the time to vote
I rode crocked like my benz with alignment broke
So it's like surprise!
With that five behind my coat
(So what the fuck you want!?!)
Yo I see the problem twin
The 38 special need revolvin'
Invasion like moving BET to Harlem
What are your fly whips and no keys to start em'
Yo I open the doa' *door* (Open the doa' yo)

Deadly venoms, on contact, my team strikes first
My squad'll attack u in threes, no need for darkman
We last man standing, who dead man walkin'

Don't get it twisted, I'm livin and dyin by the biscuit
But I risk it, I mean my life, I sacrifice
So fuck y'all twice, thats right I'm actin sheist

With the automatic pump and I'm never in the shootin slum

Never again fuck with made men
Your last breath, the kiss of death, from the Smith&Wess
Splittin' flesh and I still got a mission left
I keep they thinkin' second guess and
Mr. Unpredictable, I'm askin', spittin' loogies from my weapon
With indestructable niggas that called made man
He grabbin' shit, I grab mine, so now we blazin'
Tomorrow never dies, we suicid missionaries
(Come on cops) smokin' hats keeps my visions blurry
My right hand nigga be my nickel nine on my ways
Never hesitate to pull a gun so now you gotta face

Mean I try to hear you, leave those shells in your heads, man

Gotta let a nigga stack dough(money, money)

All the niggas fuckin in between, be the the main man
Never get stuck on the scene without a game plan, understand
I went from pop lock into tops droppin
To one of the reasons why the day parties keep rockin
No stoppin niggas is like (wa-what?)
And shorty from the south keep fuckin it up

Makin hits, is how ya'll remember me

Bettin against me
Please! my bank dont stop
I come through, bumpin Clue, with a 7-5-0
Screamin, I gots to have it, I love the dough

Nobody wanna fuck with the R.O.C

And he's banned from t.v
Nobody said life was easy
Out on the block
I got shot
And nobody came to see me
Back on my feet
Packed my heat
Got back in the beef
Blazed it up
Are ya muthafuckas lookin for me
Raized it up
And now they see I'm makin rap songs
All I ask is my real doggs smash on...
I said yea and ya dont stop
Cuz its a 1-8-7 when ya fuck wit R.O.C.!!
I said yea and ya dont quit
I'm comin live from the Bricks wit the gangsta shit
All my niggas on the corner at the end of the block
Infront of the stores, shakin my dick at the lady cop
Shakin my clip
Til the hatas drop
And I'm in a drop-top, bumpin down ya block
And I'm dumpin

I seen a lot of niggas go down the wrong path
And I learned from they mistakes, how to keep cash
In this world it's snakes
I dont care
I dont break
Pushin Benz, cuz a nigga know how to create
On and on like a jeep go
Any nigga standin in my way of my papers, automatically fonito
Suckin on the end of Rosco pico's
Trained to name
Deleted from the muthafuckin game
Ain't no mo shoppin throught the glass
Beggin for ass
If it ain't 1st class
I let it pass
Ya'll that dont got it talkin all that trash
Tryin to play tough ya'll when ya really bitch-ass
I'm the cream of the crop
The dream of the top
I'm the one they come and see when they dont want it to stop

Carribean brown skin
Queensed out from public housin
Comes the one known as the garson child, rappers is bowin
Look at em, they roll me red carpets
Praisin me as one of the dead profits
When I talk these nigga's heads bobbin
Strait out of queens when TNT did there first drug sting
When 1-800-Cop Shot stickers was first seen
When D.A.'s and cop killing laws was made
10 G's to a witness when seen a cop get sprayed
What's on the AG Q club or club Mercedes
Sunrise, movie theaters to chill with our ladies
Load up the 80's cause cop killin queens is crazy
40 to basely, Q gardens to woodhaven
To AQ boro that gotti was made in
Whips on the vanwick queens day and shea stadium
Anything that's transported to New York
Got a come through the gates of either 2 airports
Kennedy and LaGuardia we come through to body you
Bloodhounds follow you; wolves ill get on top of you
Push twin Camaro's paper here to Somalia
Blaze off double barrels,shells follow you

Four so clean like a brand new nina
My nigga Daz

You never thought Bleek walk on a track before
Hit a switch in a black 6-4 before
Down on sunset I run sets, I does that
Niggas look at me and be like damn I was that
I'm the Understanding with my peeps, fuck foes
Got a house in the back with a Benz and dough
Get cha mind right nigga 'fore you mention me

Come on (YEAH!)
Aiyyo Rock, Rock, Rock
Everybody say Rock, not Lou from suburbs to PJ's
So watch ya hootchie, groupies get dudes beat up
Or heat is leave the scene and BLAZE to get ya fleece stuck
See me on the streets 'bra, I'll break yo' teeth up and take yo' beeper
Two piece your man and let Big Noc put him in a sleeper
Then see ya, catch me in a club on a wall
Spliff in my hand, big-booty broad winin on my balls
Surrounded my thugs, maybe two or two times ten
Plus the other nine cats, my Rapper Card got in (Your Rapper Card?)
Yeah my Rapper Card, it works in live sessions
Plus barbecues, hoes, clubs, weed spots ecetera

Buckshot rock knots wit fists
Niggas stay high while I rock wit this
Mobb on y'all niggas like The Infamous
Too close wit the dillinger, two shots I don't miss
I'm wiggin out while I'm diggin out backs
Run from the gun claps, run three laps
Perhaps, them niggas you sent to carjack
Buckshot got stopped in they tracks wit macs
Now this is what I act like when I smoke on black
Stay high wit the lazy-eye, bomb wit facts
From the, street Bible or the street Quran
Fake thugs ride the dick when my shit comes on
I'm a nappy little nigga, still goin strong
You can eat a dick while I eat a thong (CLUE!)
But still the bomb

It's the wave-king, rock the two tone Wallees strip-ons
Don't wanna end up miss-on, then play your positi-on
My grimy Brooklyn niggas stay flippin ya chick
While my crew from New Jerus stay vickin ya whips
Tek is the shit, ain't nobody spittin like this
Deep impact steez been like a chromed out six
Wit the AMG kit, Ericsson wit the chip
Y'all stockin-cap copy-cats, get off the dick
I keep the livin quarter held down wit two nines
One in the bed, one in the bathroom at all times
So while I'm takin a shit, I'm at route and plan a hit
The amount we flip depends on what we get
It's like a Wall Street trick, dirty money move quick
My mans wear stones you can tip the scales wit
On they ears and wrists alone for every deaf one's bone
Look, ain't no tellin how many gats I've thrown
 (Steele)
Come on (yo for all my dogs gettin wild)
Come on (yo yo for all the shorties on the prowl)
Come on (yo yo for all the soldiers on the streets)
Come on (yo yo it's yo' time to eat)

Yo the set I claim is the set that bang
To the muthaf**kin end, I be doin my thing (YEAH!)
Lidu Rock, know the name in New York we G stackin
First the Bloods and the Crips, now bitches is carjackin
Like my nigga Craig and em say, ""F**k that shit!""
Rockin shines in the 'Ville, you better tuck that shit
Or watch yo' step baby, watch where you walk
I put a slug up in yo' mouth so that ass won't talk
For real son, now we got mad cops on the block
'cause we hold it down for Doc and I keep my heat cocked
Lidu Rock, what the f**k I know y'all niggas mad at me
So if you rep for yours go 'head take a stab at me, muthaf**ker

You a many style copy-cat, ?bendy mile? stockin cap
Fake nigga from the projects who ain't got a gat
Ruck reign supreme, aim the steam
When the gun click, your ass shit navy beans
Maybe these, niggas ain't ready for the Magnum
Force, the Holocaust, balls I just dragged them
Off lost in the sauce and of course I'm glad them
Monkey niggas don't f**k wit the Ruck 'cause they fags, son
The last one, to step to Sean P caught a bad one
Quincy toes tagged em after somebody stabbed em
Cornball niggas wit drugs thinkin they weight great
Still bummin money for stoges and a Drakes cake

Get it straight, y'all niggas f**kin wit some heavyweights
Boot Camp-ion champions on point like paper mates
Demonstrate, spectacular venacular
Smackin ya upside the back of ya head wit a spatula
Snatchin ya, off the street like police
Next week, they find your body washin up on the beach
Don't speak if you ain't at norm (ain't got nuttin to say fool)
Tally on, be gone, as we rally strong
See me in Brook-lyn where crooks be armed
Terrorial disputes leave you in memorial suites
Callin your troops, I shoot straight stay in ya place
We the type you love to hate 'cause we stay in your face
Sayin our grace before we put our hands in our plates

My shit is pure satisfaction, what more could you ask for
Wit facts like an ? ansaw? , I pour fire on earth, I been to hot raw
Do queens tires get burnt, let's peel through the real
Slide through my terrain, take a ride wit me
Check out my lifestyle, it's a off-road course

Start hoppin, 'cause when it's on we ain't stoppin

Don't got a gat stashed, you better start coppin

Now you can talk about a nigga, criticize my faults
But in new york, got it locked wit bolts, blow the vote
Overdose, while you cop block and cut throats
Me and my click's champagning, and campaigning
While you rhyme about your jewels, and sniff that shit up in your nostrils
I'll be plottin on your life, to put one up in your fossil
Niggas think they gully, on the inside sweet like honey
Niggas want the bitches, we just want the money
Federal notes, flipped blue, keys of coke store frontin watchin his dough
Tourin the coast, pardon wife due, gettin babies drunk
Call me foul, deep down, you gotta admit, you like my style
Put holes in your polo, I know your m-o, you half homo
Joinin my team, that's a no-no
Say what you want, don't let it talk for you
And that's my word, I'll have this hollow tip stored for you

One time nigga, two times nigga yo
I dig the way clueminatti got the beats rollin through the body
The type of tracks, got me killin these cats

When niggas in the hood ain't no good, carry gats
And leave you on your back in a hurry
Especially, dealin wit the money
Rockin pelle f**kin wit the spanish mami cheffin up by dellis
Now we got the guns pumpin jums out the back of a deli
Really, these chumps gettin slummed on the daily
Forty days, forty weeks, either these raps are back in the streets
Stackin cracks up in the fleece, so hav blaze the bees
And pass that to me, and I'll bless piece
So this way the whole fam eat
Be the infamous of this shit, pioneers of this
Survival of the fittest, nobody's f**kin wit this

Pitch a shut-out, the whole 9 innings

Tucked in Amil purse, all you bitches hatin' get a deal first

Now all my niggas say what

Screamin, I gots to have it, I love the dough

Nobody wanna f**k with the R.O.C
Young G from the streets
And he's banned from t.v
Nobody said life was easy
Out on the block
I got shot
And nobody came to see me
Back on my feet
Packed my heat
Got back in the beef
Blazed it up
Are ya muthaf**kas lookin for me
Raized it up
And now they see I'm makin rap songs
All I ask is my real doggs smash on...
I said yea and ya dont stop
'cause its a 1-8-7 when ya f**k wit R.O.C.!!
I said yea and ya dont quit
I'm comin live from the Bricks wit the gangsta shit
All my niggas on the corner at the end of the block
Infront of the stores, shakin my dick at the lady cop
Shakin my clip
Til the hatas drop
And I'm in a drop-top, bumpin down ya block
And I'm dumpin
Chorus 2X

I seen a lot of niggas go down the wrong path
And I learned from they mistakes, how to keep cash
In this world it's snakes
I dont care
I dont break
Pushin Benz, 'cause a nigga know how to create
On and on like a jeep go
Any nigga standin in my way of my papers, automatically fonito
Suckin on the end of Rosco pico's
Trained to name
Deleted from the muthaf**kin game
Ain't no mo shoppin throught the glass
Beggin for ass
If it ain't 1st class

Ya'll that dont got it talkin all that trash
Tryin to play tough ya'll when ya really bitch-ass

We trade war stories back on the streets
When we played em messhall
Niggas get'em on his eats
Im a foul little nigga, wild little nigga
Dedicated to these streets a pump valve little nigga
You hear about my wherabouts?

We sip bacardi darked wit sprite all night
Till the sky get bruised or thug nigga lose
Pull out two-two's only catch two, hundred
Half the crowd skated ?when? which you wanted
This nigga got shaky and panic when you fronted
When he saw the black kron
I thought the nigga wore a thong
The way he froze his arm
Dukes said its on
He stripped to his drawers when he heard one raw
Took off half ass when the nigga spit more
And we all spit game you niggas ?heard free? game
By soft motherf**kers, you lame mothef**kers
I fall, I get back
To test my worth
I tell heads to hit that, its raw get rid of that
My worker take thirty off a bundle
Dodging the bikers, and'em D's
When they rush the jungle
So we stash in the fences
Sit low on the benches
Keep a small gun in case its on in the trenches
Yo
CHORUS:2x
We live
For the thugged niggas, Marcy

See, this whole DJ gang be peepin' on this shit from the gate tho
You know I've been seein', you know the pioneers they just come and just lay it down for young niggas like this nigga here
But this nigga right here, he changed the whole game up
There's a lot of niggas that was, you know making the tapes and shit like that
This nigga right here made this shit like a  or somethin'
He started to get a whole lot of paper
Ridin' around in a Benz
Lex coups and all these types of shit
He is the first nigga to put the mixtapes in CDs
Matter of fact, he is the first nigga that I want to motherfuckin' kill
due to the fact that he leaked one of my Biggie records
The time has come, give this man his respect
He's one of the greatest DJ's of all time
He's the first nigga that started gettin' DJs some motherfuckin' paper
Started to put some ice on 'em
Really started fuckin with the bitches and all that shit
He from the crew called 'Desert Storm'
By the way, I go by the name P. Diddy, yeah y'all know me
We here to talk 'bout that nigga DJ Clue, so yeah
Motherfuckers paid 19 dollars for the tape sit back and enjoy the tape, Biatch!",https://genius.com/Dj-clue-intro-the-professional-annotated
Cops & Robbers (feat. Lord Tariq & Muggs),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Lord Tariq & Muggs talking)
Trying to tell you man
I'm going up in there
Trying to dig into niggas pockets
F**k that man
-{Lord Tariq}-
Either you be real or you be dead
Hey killer, be a killer
That's the rules to this game
In the court of the law
With let niggas that feel ya
They know cat dealers
But with some new shit, like Clue shit
We strap for this thriller
You hit the crack house, you pull a mack out
Cock the mack back, blow his back out
And take the back route
And that's what that's about
Understand? I wan't cans in hand
This shit is real, never phony
Don't come short with my mo-ney
I'll only tell you once Tony
""Don't f**k me, don't you ever try to f**k me""
If so, trust me, you outta luck B
And try to sit high where them drugs be
Filthy rich looking broke
F**k a bitch I wan't the world thust
Keeping feds of my ass
I gotta think fast
'Cause black man white town you know this shit won't last
We try to bumble like ass
Stay low, got to hurl that cash
Into the trouble blow past, that's how you do it
Chorus:
We got cops and robbers
Niggas and spicks
Flashy cars, ghetto stars
Moving stones and bricks
It ain't over on the streets
We got blocks to get
So heads up, guns cock
Don't get rocked to this
(2X)
-{Lord Tariq}-
Now if the good die young
Then what the f**k that makes me?
And who the f**k are you to rape me?
Less then the best, bulletproof love
The thugs holding it down in the decks
And for the frauds I got techs
Heading straight for your chest
Feel me on this
My word is priceless
You can't pawn this
I might diss drop jewels
The way I cop jewels
The way my nine drops flues
The way my mind influes
What's a nigga to do a murder
Type of shit you never heard of
From jimbos to fat burger
On some last long shit
I be doing this forever like that nigga Von Zeil
Plus I calm shit, I bomb shit
I had alot of Brooklyn niggas
Saying ""Yeah them Bronx niggas they get down""
So hold your heat up, and move fast
You got to keep
Because Clue, Minnesota, Lord Tariq run these streets what
Nigga peep up, talking to the sidewalk
And there's nothing to comprehend
When my nine talks
Chorus(2X)
-{Muggs}-
I peep the devil screaming BK
'Cause I rock for B.I.G
Live like pop did, shells couldn't stop the kid
In some rap I pack, used to be in passing for crack
Molka type of lid with a passing for stacks
Dreads call me African Black named after my medicine
Street veteran with one gun
Killed eleven men
It's too crazy, y'all fake tough guys with full gazi's
Blue mercedes, three pounds under the blue avy
Bomb crews my mind power beyond you
Now I push your hair line back
Do what the con do
I warned you, and sworn no talking
Bring the thing out
Got the block surrounded like cops
And shots rang out
Animal instinct, blood type is therobreed
Run with thero heads
Leave you in another burough bed
Respect my hood, like the heats do
Be k to the Bronx
Poor kane, Lord Tariq & Clue
Chorus(2x)

Made Men (feat. Made Men),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Extraordinary
(New shit, Made Men)
The undisputed Made Men

Ey yo
Retreat your betallion quick, before your time run out
(Nigga) I see you sweatin', don't try a reachable gunout
We take no prisoneers, never leavin' witnesses
Deadly venoms, on contact, my team strikes first
My squad'll attack u in threes, no need for darkman
We last man standing, who dead man walkin'
It's five fingers to death, when I clutch
The microphone in my hand
I know you niggas don't understand
Play my position, hold it down just like De Niro
One of the coldest, Mortal Kombat, Sub-Zero
I shot the shit outly, whippin the hantle clinch fisted
Don't get it twisted, I'm livin and dyin by the biscuit
But I risk it, I mean my life, I sacrifice
So f**k y'all twice, thats right I'm actin sheist
When shots pop off, you betta duck when I done
With the automatic pump and I'm never in the shootin slum
My face isn't definately the law
In the jigsaw, puzzle
While I screw and muscle on my six-saw
Bringin it to ya ass, in a way you never felt it
Yo whole f**kin' staff, who get they wigs melted
When I'm rushed out, fresh out
Verbal bash-out
P.D.'s that made man
Ready to get off for some action

(You wanna roam in these streets cousin', every man for themselves)
... when you dealin' with some made men
(You wanna roam in these streets cousin', every man for themselves)
... don't be sleepin' on these made men
(You wanna roam in these streets cousin', every man for themselves)
... when you f**kin' with some made men
(You wanna roam in these streets cousin', every man for themselves)

Yo, its warfare, I'm splittin your hair, with a missle
Cos I be squezzin' that type of shit up out my pistol
Don't talk that tone, if you ain't gon' spark the chrome
You shook and ain't got no tests, starts the roam
Yo, we man of respect, with our own dialect
Elements surprise, wise guys, skill you ain't acquirin' yet
I'm on that, hot rock and punk contact
Combat, doubt that can so you contract
Close casket, with the eight by ten
Sittin on top of the coffin
Never again f**k with made men
Your last breath, the kiss of death, from the Smith&Wess
Splittin' flesh and I still got a mission left
I keep they thinkin' second guess and
Mr. Unpredictable, I'm askin', spittin' loogies from my weapon
With indestructable niggas that called made man
He grabbin' shit, I grab mine, so now we blazin'
Tomorrow never dies, we suicid missionaries
(Come on cops) smokin' hats keeps my visions blurry
My right hand nigga be my nickel nine on my ways
Never hesitate to pull a gun so now you gotta face
These never-minded motherf**kers with advances
Mean I try to hear you, leave those shells in your heads, man
My man, ok probably unmistakently
Motherf**kers, who make a homicide and never mystery

(You wanna roam in these streets cousin', every man for themselves)
... when you dealin' with some made men ...",https://genius.com/Dj-clue-made-men-feat-made-men-lyrics
