Flava in Ya Ear,Project: Funk Da World,1994.0,"Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and…

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear",https://genius.com/Craig-mack-flava-in-ya-ear-lyrics
Get Down,Project: Funk Da World,1994.0,"And bass up the track a little bit
'Cause I wanna hear that ""boompsh, boompsh""
You know I'm sayin'?
Ahhh!

Now who got the flav' that comes a dime a dozen that keeps ‘em buzzin’
Thinking that they fat when they wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack, or Mackman
Leave you small guys sayin', I eat MC's like Pac-Man
I'm incredible, better eats ya vegetables
'Cause, I does what I do you (Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin', mackin', full effect mike check one two
I'ma reign, reign forever
Rain like bad weather, reign like whoever, never
You can't bite my style
'Cause my style ain't a style that is a style so I can go buckwild
Bet you figured you got more funk for flow, it ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second from the hook, dook
Scrap ya rap book, 'fore you get ya wet style shook

Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?

The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MC's leaves a foul scent
See, I'm like what ya call, king of yes ya'll
My style's rick, sick, I mean real sick
Shit's thick, I come with the ammo
The real whammo-slammo stuff that I be droppin'
And I'll wake the great, let's warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'ma castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to 'til it stank, you stomp, I dominate
See, I ain't scared of you mothafuckas
To me ya all suckers 'cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us, we roll bulletproof
No cooth, on the roof, 
bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down

Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?

Can leap a tall building, crush the Earth for fun
But I'm sayin' ain't no fair, yo, when MC's run (Ain't no fair, ain't no fair)
The mic's now in the right hands
'Cause the Mack’s on the Earth just to spoil your plans
More pep than the pepper that's in ya pepper shaker
Ruff earthquaker, couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring with unknown to man slang
With bigger bite than the Devil fang
I ain't met who could hang, if ya testin' in ya lesson
Got me dressin' for ya funeral session
Man, it won't even matter no more
Craig in '94 just won the war
My style was definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin' lookin' over in a four door Chevy Nova (Why I oughta)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of dollars, ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is ""Get Down""
So let me get down and pound other MC's in the ground

Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?
Can I get down?
Get on down, can I get down?

Get down, boy (Down, down)
Can I get down? (Hah)
Can I get down? (Down, down)
Can I get down?",https://genius.com/Craig-mack-get-down-lyrics

Peace to Brentwood Town Shipping
I'm smoother than that Lex your whipping
With the rack and pinion
And Pirelli tires that be gripping
Sometimes I wonder if MCs really know
Mack's eternal bought to burn you
While in ten feet, of snow
I grab the mic and turn into Ali Baba
With just a dabber, my rhymes are guaranteed to grab ya
I got funk with the bass and soul
Cause I've been rockin' on the mic since nine years old
And I can groove with that, stupid fat
Rhymers when you're soupin' that
MCs catch a headache
And find where some Nuprins at
I'm on the case like Magnum P.I., F.B.I
Lookin for a man with the reason why
And it'll cost more than Lee Majors
To fix MCs after I kicks my flavor
Puff and Puff and blow the House down
Is what the Mack do whenever I get down
Gettin' down, boy (get down)
One two, Mack man's in full effect

Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow

I'm like the greatest rapper, known to man
Got MCs meltin' in mouth and not inside my hand (c'mon)
And you can try to, write a rhyme-a
But the pace that I race'll have you lookin' like a old timer (old timer)
Do you wanna pay a visit, to rhyme exquisite (aheh)
That'll leave you standin' colder than a winter blizzard (AHH)
Mack's engaging, extra blazin'
Who's you phasing?
Power Rangers ain't more amazin' (amazin')
Rhyme flipper, flip-a-rhyme=a-ripper (uh-huh, say what)
Rip-a-rhyme-double-dipper while you talkin' on my zipper
I wanna know who's been naughty or nice
With the device, turnin' grown men into mice (yeah)
I can flip funk back and forth, forth and back
Ride more super rhymes against the track, tell 'em Mack (tell em)
I got Bad Boy as my back (that's right)
As we kick on the funk called MC subtract
Got flow for days, got rhymes to amaze (uh-huh, c'mon)
Got the brand new funk, here's the brand new craze, boy
Mack the dope (one two)
We break all of the funk on down (yeah)
[Chorus: Diddy & 
Craig Mack

Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (
Mo Bee, make it..

Gotta keep my flow (
Bustin out, in the house

Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
(
One two, as we get busier
)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (
We gon' get like this
)
Gotta keep my flow

Come on everybody, let's all get down
Got rhymes by the ton while you weighs a pound (Whoo)
Supercalifragilistic type of hyper MC
That be me, twenty-twenty could not see (Can't see)
I don't feel the pressure, of an MC aggressor
That I got a rhyme for in my top dresser
(in your top dresser) Craig Mack, 
Bad Boy representin
Fat Funkster be gettin', for Fat Funk be hittin' (C'mon)
It's this man's turn to earn
Since my birth, a penny now is MC's worth (C'mon)
And MC's are nuttin' but a joke-a take a toke-a
Smoke fatter than the Ayatollah
Can't nuttin' ever stop the Craig Mack plans
To grab MCs, and crush em in my hands (as we get busier)
Like I said before, here comes the Mack
Power-packed in black, to make you see mad graphics
As we get busier (As we get busier)
In nine-four with the funk that hits on the floor

Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough

When God Comes,Project: Funk Da World,1994.0,"What da fuck's going on inside the biz
Shit ain't raw no more
Fake is how it is
I hear brothers talking 'bout shooting and killing
Then going home and chilling
Frontin' like a villain
Let me tell you something real
Is how the Mack feel
I ain't no criminal and represent no steel
I tell you one thing though
MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth
To let you know
I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God
To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod
You MC's have been too bad
So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had
When MC's disappear it's my fault
It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt
And radio ya need to be ashamed
For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in
Our brain
I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it
Representing truth when the Mack
Starts to mike it
I hope the subject don't turn ya away
But the whole Hip-Hop generation need to pray
Chorus
Whatcha gon do when God comes
You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get strapped for when God comes
Cuz you won't know how to act, when God comes
Now we all established dat Mack's new king
And the king for his people has to represent the
Right thing
Brothers in the ghetto stop genociding
Cause same boat we riding, will do like the 
Poseidon
I watched the earth's cheese line get longer, I watch
Allegiance to Satan's army looking stronger
I watched drugs and guns take control
I even watched how the devil take the Black woman's soul
They ain't got respect no more
When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore
Ladies you need to help out your man
Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand
The Black family is now prehistoric
And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick
We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please
Lord help us shake this disease
And MC's don't take these rhymes for no joke
Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword
You stroke
So take heed to the words that I send
Cause on Judgement Day everey man must attend
Chorus
All our Black leaders are throwing on they war paint
I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint
How long can we sing that song
Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong
And don't figure Mack new to get started
Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded
I'm talking from veteran chair prepare
MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear
Shape up ya Lord about to strike
With thunder claps that turn day into night
With something similar to Gabriel's horn
The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn
Peace to Bad Boy for bring me here
People of the world presenting Mack this year
No need for fronting his time has almost came
And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name

Jockin My Style,Operation: Get Down,1997.0,"Here comes a rhyme in your ear Craig Mack is here so have no fear
My rhymes push the hack to the rear
I'm severe rap pioneer with funk I steer now it's clear
Rhymes flow to the break of dawn
Exploring MC's I get silly on, like Ponce De Leon
Yet don't foget my style is a banger
MC's I deposit in the closet on a hanger
Mack chop your rhymes like I chop shop chop a Acc
Startin with the bones in your back
Whenever I attack it's like a blow from a axe
Sweet like sugar that be on Sugar Smacks
Facts is Mr. or Mrs
Can't another rapper see me when it's time for gettin biz
And the moral of the story as you will see
Is that from now on the greatest rapper is me
Chorus:
MC's you're jockin my style, you're jockin my style boy
You're jocking my style, MC's stop jockin my style
You know you can't touch the flav
MC's you're jockin my style, you're jockin my style boy
You're jocking my style, MC's stop jockin my style
Craig Mack has the phat funk flav
Now I'm sayin, rock funk to the Himalayan
No more delaying, MC's you decaying, I'm staying
Cause now I'm out my cage
And what I do for rap is gonna make front page
Remember back in the days I was just a tyke
I do a rhyme while I do a wheelie riding bike
But now I'm the man with the mic in my hand
Starving MC's like them kids from Siam
Breaker breaker, it's the funk rhyme shaker
Super duper superb slamming like a Laker
Swimmin on MC's like moray eels with mass appeal
Your rhymes are jokes like Dangerfield's
Boy, I'll tell ya, ain't no liver on this continent
I'm dope and you the opposite, the man when I be dropping shit
Raw, I give MC's a headache
Hit your ass so hard and kill your man by mistake
Youse a fake ladies and real niggas know
Non-stop rockin til it's time to go so bust the flow
I'm a be a round for a while
MC's stop jockin my style
Chorus
Now everybody put your hands in the air
Wave them shits like you just don't care, aiyyo
You could have a dollar or be a millonaire
Sometimes I think that Mack should be mayor
Now me, myself and I, we three bad motherfuckers
Here to eliminate suckers
I came to rock a party are you ready
Get your Aunt Millie's out eat MC's like spaghetti
Rap machete, I'll cut your ass like a sword
Into buying rhymes these rhymes you can't afford
I shine like jewelry, ain't nobody schoolin me
I battle anybody just point to who the fool be
Cause you and me, we ain't the same type of breed
I grab the mic and give the crowd what they need, and proceed
To rock the mic since a child
Get off my tip and stop jocking my style

(Opps there goes another rubber tree)
(Opps there goes another rubber tree)
Now I came to rock, I came to move the crowd
I came screamin' out loud
No other choice is this bad new voice
Can't wait to sit in my new Rolls Royce
You soft and moist, sweet like cake
Don't be scared to lie down in the bed you make
And if you fake, I'm like Alexander the Great
A conquerer, stompin ya, for even steppin to the plate
Now you think I'm late but I'm right on time
You had your chance to do it now it's my turn to shine
Keep in mind, you ain't heard my flow in a while
And I still ain't heard nobody that can fuck with my style
Juliet child nigga cook MC's, Criag Mack baby 1000 degrees
Stand back nigga I'mma shake this place
And look just when you thought it was safe?


Now inside the streets Craig Mack's a living Legend
Nucular weapon better watch where you steppin'
Story at 6 and see the film at 11
You can be Kit but I'm like Frank Drebin
Mary Lou Retton, flippin on yall
You can use Motrin, Advil or Tylonol
Just to see me ball make your chick wanna follow
Rock the Meadowlands you got Boo-ed on Apollo
Real hard to swollow wanna know how come?
Cause I'm hot-dog probably buring meat off your tongue
So from now on till thy king-don-com
The sea-son has begun from my style to weigh a ton
Kill you for fun but I ain't playin no games (no games)
And I ain't sayin no names (uh-uh)
But next time you kill somebody make sure they dead
But wait, you can check this in-stead


I see you made it to the bonus round, see my crown?
Pretty, too bad you can't touch it
I'm like Pompeii first time it erupted
Chicks still call acting hungry as a buzzard
You can let your man dump it hug it and love it
Touch it and rub it, Mack nigga, that's why it sounds undiscoverd
Explode like L. Ron Hubbard, on the Dianetics Cover, smother a brother
Been ""Lethal"" for years ask Gibson and Glover
Your man be like ""Help!"", lying in the gutter
Just like that, ""Splash me the Cash""
Shit I'm like Duke Nukem get ready for combat
I now pronounce you man and wife
You may, kiss the coffin it's the end of your life Mr. Mack
And I know how to land this bird
Bet I see you 2000 nigga that's my word

So any time you're gettin low, 'stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant",https://genius.com/Craig-mack-the-wooden-horse-lyrics

My momma said back when I was born
That you was warned, so now your ass gets torn

My style is bonafide
Fortified on my bad side, an MC on a high
Now we about to set this off
Bass and funk rattlin (one two) send MC's up North
I never had to fight with the mic
I make the funk so dynamite
So parasite MC's might wanna bite
Welcome to 1994 (welcome) beats that thump
Rhymes that's bumpin now at your backdoor
Never figured Mack got funk for days (what)
When ""Project: Funk Da World"" brought the brand new craze
(wake it up)
And MC's can't get one line
When the genuine take out deep max on your mind
I'mma hit you with the boom pow
Bolder than Moscow, MC's your judgment's now
Here it comes
MC's.. your judgment is.. now (now MC's)
MC's your judgment day is now (it's time, here it comes)
MC's.. your judgment is.. (hahhh) now
As we get down - MC's your judgment day is now
Here it comes, boyeee
Here comes the one they call King MC
If you're tired of those phony fake rhymes that be (fake)
I'm back with this deeper than Minds of Minolta
Preachin better than preacher up on an altar

I feel that I have pardoned, pardoned
No need for bad grammar startin in my MC garden

And I'mma kinda hungry tonight
So I pulls out the ground a fat rhyme to recite
I don't means to boast but the most is me your host
On post, kickin flav til they ghost (ghost)
Craig Mack is here to stay
Rugged as a mountain bike on MC judgment day
(go ahead)
From now until the Earth's gone
In the chess game of rap, MC's ain't nothin but a pawn
(your move)
As the rap romps through your town (through your town)
And MC's around, time to put your panties down (put it down)
MC's.. your judgment is.. now (it's time)
MC's your judgement is now (MC's, check your clock, it's on)
MC's (MC's) your judgment is.. (hahhh) now (Mack the dope)
MC's your judgment day is now (with the flav, gettin down)
It was a rumble tumble, I put the bee inside the bumble
Kickin wicked type of hyper, won't never fumble (ahh)
I float like a tugboat do
Watch the virus, Mack the dope, start affectin you
Is rap real? You can't deal, what's the matter?
The badder the Don Dadda is still gettin fatter
You be lovin how it sound and shit
And have you dance when I battle for the sponsorin
And you can thank Bad Boy for that
A technique for layin MC's on the mat
Scat, scoot, pussy couldn't make a louder hoop
When I pollute, the world with funk to the roof
Mad rhymes we bust, in God we trust
And MC's don't discuss when ya turn back to dust
(Ashes to ashes)
Mark the year, 1994.. when MC's hit the floor
MC's.. your judgment is.. (hahhh) now
MC's your judgment is now (Final Call, MC's, we get down)
MC's.. your judgment is.. (here comes the Mack) now

Waitin' for my house fat pool plus a sauna

""I can get real raw.."" plus my style is hardcore (4X)
Service with the wild style, freak a smile
I'm crazier than ever, PLEASE pull my lever
Oooh I can't wait, I'm paid, I see him
Brothers on my jock, a G for per diem
MC's that are down please stay down..
CRAIG MACK FOR PRESIDENT! Fuck around
My nature's to hate ya, my style of MC'in
To dust and crush I bust every human bein
Dig it, I'm cool but one rule, don't act fool
My four-fifth's a tool, I have aim
Hey, hush it down, quiet, I'm speakin
Unique technique and style that I am freakin
Peakin, speakin like a deacon or a pastor
The master, baby, death, okay G?
Let's get back to the issue with judicial
Weepin willow grab a pillow 'fore I have to diss you
I'm concrete, hard as the street, like pavement
Leavin heads bleedin, strictly in amazement
Surrender, with more 'ups than Alcindor
I'll bend ya, you're tender, next agenda
""I can get real raw.."" plus my style is hardcore (4X)
Yeah.. check this out
I belong in a hospital insane
Life fast lane on the brain like Bruce Wayne
A telltale won't fail or get stale
Cause I'm stuck like braille as I walk on a 3rd rail
Manson's my grandson, not so handsome
I'm grotesque -- FUCK IT -- girls still rub my chest
I'm G with James Brown, ""Give it Up or Turn Me Loose""
I'm terror on the red lines, prank phonin Zeus
Craig Mack's the brother that attacks at random
MC's I slammed em, cause I'm fat as Ralph Cramdem
Ras, bumba claat, boy I kill ya
MC's I'm a thriller, from here to Manilla
Lay down, nothin but facts, jacks
The blackjack ace to the beatdown max
Relax, this is just wax on my single
More chips on my shoulder than the chips made by Pringle
So how do you figure? I'm stronger than your liquor
Wild Irish Rose, huh, strike a pose
I'm death to an MC, below like Jack Dempsey
A shark feedin frenzy, on those that tempt me
One more score for the war, SEE-YA!

Funk Wit Da Style,Project: Funk Da World,1994.0,"Aww shit, here come the man again
You know if you can't with the style that's goin on right now
Then you need to be sittin down
If MC's can't get with the style that's goin on
Then you need to sit down
Do your thing Mack, do it to 'em nigga! Ahh whassup?
What you don't know, what you don't know, kick 'em in the grill
""But anyway, I'd like to take this.. anyway, I'd
Anyway, I'd like to this time out to bother you""
Oh no no no no
No I don't think you can get liver than me G
So sit back, relax, Mack's about to attack
And turn your flav into Similac cause it's like that
I kick funk out the frame, make it insane
With all local stops set to crumble like a (?) train
My thickest format, my format's thicker all that
No comp for combat with bwoy like Supercat
Show you where my head's at I crack you with a bat
Where the funk? Hear the trunk a bit and fat knit(?)
Rearrange the skit make it fit so you can't sit
Now ain't that some shh.. I rip it
I snap a jaw, I stabba jab a dinosaur
Live from Creedmore under the floor
It's like the roughest of ruffnecks, wicked and (?)
Check the (?) MC and his project
All you brothers need to know doe
There's no more best MC cause that is now me
See, G, I am king MC
Once said from me can't another brother disagree
Got the funk bleedin all out your trunk
And there's all there is to it (that's all there is)

If you can't funk with the style that's goin on
Then you need to be sittin down

You must got no brains in ya head
I kill ya dead on the spot with the hits I got
Trust my flavor G, I make ya wanna pee-pee
I got what you can't see, somethin like a leprosy
I slow it dowwwwn, somethin like.. this
When it's time for me to stun 'em
MC's I warned them..
I'll put 'em on the moon without funk to listen to
Then again, my vibration
May give the sensation they're on vacation
Y'all brothers need a (?)
Real rugged alligator MC hater from the fader
You little tic-tac, tryin to act like a lumberjack
Sit back and watch how the earth crack
You funk around, you lay around, that's how it goes
And I suppose MC's still wanna try me
King of the mountain is a hard rock
Do you understand, smile and I'll take you out like the mob
Check it black, after the Mack there's no recoup
Not even soup, get out shake the hula hoop
Comin out the ground..
Gettin down..


Sometimes alone I be writin
Must be frightenin, to hear I'm on the air
But I don't care, (?) 'til I'll see you sick(?)
Son, grandson, no tellin when I'm done (no tellin baby)
I'm about do you and you on some new
Who has a date and thank you for waitin
There my bad, I thought you took a beatin in the brain
Then you learned from rap that rap's a mistake
You won't get a break
Big as a cake for me to make, and you bake
So, banzaii, here comes the flyest guy
That you ever heard in your lifetime (yup yup yup)
I do a behind..
And rewind, I wanna kick some more shit
Down your faucet, I pours it
Mighta lost it, but then I retrieve it
Believe it, I got this fat okey-dokey style for a while
Peace from the king
Peace from the king G, here it go
One time for your motherfunkin mind

Anyway, here comes the Mack back in full effect
My man Biggie Smalls in the shit, you know what I'm saying
He tryna hold me back, you know what I'm saying
And won't let me get down, but you know what? I'm getting down?

Let me get down, let me get down

To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man (ahh!)
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker, huh?
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras (let me get down!)
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin', huh?
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-uh (I know the flavor, yeah)
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin' comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin' her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she try to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
""Why you wanna, play your games on me?""
Bitch, ya crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real blood-spill shit (ah!)
My rappin' tactics are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigree (ahhh!)
You better be, filled with energy, niggas never gettin me (get down!)
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down! (Aaaah, ahh!)

Let me get down, let me get down

'Cause the rhyme that I kick is called the MC stomp
Here comes the one they call king of the MCs
Shaking down enemies with rhymes like these, boy
I'm bad, bad to the bone
Freaking up styles, wickity wild
Pass the microphone
I tell you suckers strange, Biggie my man
I got MCs melting inside my mouth and not inside my hand
My species eliminates MCs
 with 3rd degrees
I bring the funk from the floors, MCs here
So from here to Warsaw I roar
The maclalicious, this nigga's vicious
MC from '94 leaves your ho making wishes
No saving MCs misbehavin'
I got the funk bleeding all out the trunk
Names all over, so I'm going for the pump
I come from the underground, so let me get down
Let him get down, let me get down

Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down

Realer than real, as Mack gets the steel

Still recording
Uh-huh
When God comes down

Now I know, to the world, the rap I kick
Will make you think I'm a lunatic
Lost my mind, I'm mentally sick
But for all mankind, this is it
New kingdom on the earth where the devil don't fit
No more bad times and no more wars
New Jerusalem, the city with the gold on the floors
Righteous laws, a thousand year 
The earth rejuvenated, Christ illuminated
I fight for the cause, kick down doors
The devil set up and I'm about to erupt
Mack's a warrior, I wear the armor of God
Fix your face, raise the bass, and stop lookin' so hard
You see, praisin' the Lord is easy for me
Craig Mack's right where he's supposed to be
You not close to me, you foes to me
The saints praise God and the Pope praises rosary
See, we about to take it to the next millenium
On Judgement Day, I know where He sendin' 'em
The earth and God on one accord
And I'll be in the choir singin', ""Praise the Lord""

When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
It's all upside down before He turn it around
You better praise the Lord
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
(Boyy)

Now y'all ask the question, ""Where's Craig Mack?""
Then you two played me at the Tabernac'
Jumpin' up and down with the Prophet of God
Givin' praise to my King 
who was bruised and scarred
Set me free, gave me a charge
A night to remember like El DeBarge
Gave away my cars, turned in all my guns
'Cause the Mack stayed with beef like hamburger buns
Sold my home, moved my family
South Carolina, y'all could stay mad at me
If I stayed in New York, it's just another tragedy
So God cleaned me up while y'all was still raggedy
Sore as a cavity, depravity, your face in calamity
Your ego on a high like we ain't got gravity
Your majesty, please forgive
This world gives you death, but I wanna live
What you gonna do When God Comes?
To me, the best song on the album
If you don't turn around, you know the outcome
'Cause Hell's a place that you ain't never comin' out from

When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
It's all upside down before He turn it around
You better praise the Lord
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
One God, one Savior, one Lord, all aboard
Singin', ""Praise the Lord""
(Boyy, c'mon)

I mean, look at all this hate stuff and gay stuff
Men wearin' make-up
Sodomy and bodily parts that don't fit
Lesbians and thespians and sacred planetarians
Aquarians and Martians, and angels and guardians, they partyin'
Puttin' fake food in their body and they pottyin'
Head-choppin', nerve-droppin',  face cryin'
Terrorists is bombin' 'em and governments that's armin' 'em
These are the last days 
When God comes down to burn like sun rays
They got you thinkin' that it's just a phase
But Mack'll tell you now give God the praise
Skies full of  to change your brain waves
They want you in the zone, they'll call your cellphone
Put a camera on your home, you never alone
You gotta  with a chip in his bone
The earth moan and groan, waitin' for God to come
I'm not alone, but I can rap 'til my tongue gets numb
If you don't understand what I'm sayin' to you
There's nothing I'll be able to do in 16

When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
It's all upside down before He turn it around
You better praise the Lord
Jesus Christ is the only way you gonna be saved
You better praise the Lord

On Da Run,Game Over II ,UnKnown,"Eh yo, god bless the dead, ya know?
And all my cats I know with the football jerseys on: dont have no regrets
Hold them numbers
Big up to the feds who tried to catch me in 88, nigga
Ha! Funk Flav, Mr. Mack
Eh yo, I can't face going to jail
Cuz my life is bullshit, man, nigga fuck paying bail
Shit is on the third rail
On my tail is the feds, baby, Frank ?? for club med
Niggas wanna kill me, god
Scared I might wrap these niggas
Entrap these niggas
If the feds wasn't watching I would clap these niggas
I mean put a bullet through the fuckin back of these niggas
Phone ringing off the hook, probably tapped my niggas
See the headlines now: ""Mack found in 5 rivers""
FDR, thinkin was it better when I didn't buy the car
Didn't cop the bar, didn't buy my girl mother a new jaguar
Shit, my moms got the Continental R with the backseat bar
Talkin about ""my sons a star""
Little do she know I'm Caesar and world ???
Crack is dead, I'm sellin X instead
Bitches in my bed will fill your ass with lead
Keep givin me head 'til the tip turns red
Sit back and watch me butter this bread

On the run
Best three words to describe my life, make the game my wife
On the run
Hustler, born and raised, in the streets where I spent my days

I told my main chick, pack your bags, She ain't listen
Chrome started whistling and turned her Christian
Blew up the whole house using nitro-glycerin
But the Expedition in the garage was missing
Moved the nannies and the kids to a new position
Intuition gave me suspicion
Shit is murder, do I kill myself and fuck them niggas' satisfaction
Or demand action, pull out toast and start blasting
Young niggas asking, wise cats only give a fraction
Streets is the young man's attraction
I dug myself into a hole
Into a world thats cold
Pimps, players, bitches, ballers, hustlers, drugs, guns and thugs
Million dollar homes, like Capone's, persian rugs
Gentlemen with fake hugs, turn to slugs
I'm a made man, paid man, show no love
Clock's ticking, plot thicken, probably written in a book somewhere
My fuckin life ain't fair
See either way, i'ma make it off this earth without a trace
So if I ever see the judge, i'ma spit in the bitch face


Eh yo, faggots
Nah i'm sayin, all you sweet cats, nahmean?
Real gentleman dont need it
Its strictly drive-thru window meals
Enemies lurking every crack and crevice, eating rocks for breakfast
No time for music, carry toast and use it
See your house and uz' it
Test your life and lose it
You heard Gotti, shit is all fucked up
His family didn't even wanna check him
Disrespect and neglect him
In a place to correct him
Disconnect him and stretch him
While the bull cop police protection
Shit is question
My suggestion in the game of deception
Is to reign with aggression
With the guns for collection
The whores you undressing, keep 'em inside the best western
You want a firm investment?
Nigga, go have a kid, and let him eat your steak
Dont make the same mistake
Hope the kid is strong, when i'm gone
You'll be like pop-duke was the man, but his life was wrong
Gunned down off the top like Kong

I came screamin' out loud
No other choice is this bad new voice
Can't wait to sit in my new Rolls Royce
You soft and moist, sweet like cake
Don't be scared to lie down in the bed you make
And if you fake, I'm like Alexander the Great
A conqueror, stompin' ya, for even steppin' to the plate
Now you think I'm late but I'm right on time
You had your chance to do it now it's my turn to shine
Keep in mind, you ain't heard my flow in a while
And I still ain't heard nobody that can fuck with my style

But wait, you can check this in-stead


I see you made it to the bonus round, see my crown?
Pretty, too bad you can't touch it
I'm like Pompeii first time it erupted
Chicks still call acting hungry as a buzzard
You can let your man dump it hug it and love it
Touch it and rub it, Mack nigga, that's why it sounds undiscovered
Explode like L. Ron Hubbard, on the Dianetics Cover, smother a brother
Been ""Lethal"" for years ask Gibson and Glover
Your man be like ""Help!"", lying in the gutter
Just like that, ""Splash me the Cash""
Shit I'm like Duke Nukem get ready for combat
I now pronounce you man and wife
You may, kiss the coffin it's the end of your life Mr. Mack

Bet I see you 2000 nigga that's my word

Street Fighter, Mackalicious fat funk flav'
For ya headphones, bwoiii
(LOOK!) I bet you thought you could beat Blanka
Mo' flav' than the chocolate made by Willy Wonka
Zangief'll hit you harder than a Tonka
Truck bet a buck USSR will stomp ya
Now M. Bison had this plan
And had the hostages inside the palm of his hand
Now we all know Dhal's the man
But in the world of rap Craig Mack'll turn ya into sand
Jane, haircut like she spent a summer at E. Honda's
Stomach wonder in four digit number (chomp, chomp chomp chomp)
I got Sagat on the spot just to rock your knot
He got kicks like I got rhymes to the sho' shot
A Street Fighter, funky rhymer, drop-a-dimer
Bound to action pack, yo Jack, greatest-of-all-timer
Here comes the hook again~!
Mackalicious that po' flav' will make your hair Ken

Do you have, what it takes, to be a Street Fighter?
{*""One by one I'm knockin you out""*}
I don't think you have what it takes to be a Street Fighter
{*""One by one I'm knockin you out""*}

Momma don't let your babies grow up to be MC's
Cause they'll freeze (freeze 'em up Mack)
I got this real strange disease
That makes knees bend like hurricanes do the palm trees
Now Dhalsim is slim hittin harder than a Timb
Whem the rubberband man gets in
Peace to Balrog as I kick the monologue
Thicker than fog and heavier than Boss Hog
I heard Vega got Spain locked down
With tournaments, with ornaments underground
And Chun-Li reportin, with real brain distortin
Kicks fix your back for back brace supportin
And knees bend for Ken, no pretend
From beginnin to the end, Mackalicious rhymes'll win (everytime)
And call yourself a fighter if you wanna
But you'll be a type of fighter lyin all up in the corner
Mack you can't bite-a, silly overnighter
Flake-ass rhyme writer, Mack's a Street Fighter (here it comes)
It's time bwoi (bwoi, as we get down)
As we bring the funk on down for Street Fighter


A Street Fighter, ain't just a game no more
Too raw, you'll get kicked out the back door
If fightin fo' position is your mission then keep on wishin
(Keep on wishin and hopin and prayin and..)
I mean this man on the mic got mo' flav' for days so listen
(So listen up with the funk)
I'm out with these be-about rhymes that the Mack'll shout
Punchin through bricks and turnin bodies out
A Street Fighter, is now in the house
Type of hype that will amaze, Street Fighter brand new craze
(Brand new craze~!) As we get on down
Street Fighter moves leave another fighter in the ground
 with ad libs

Praying to God that my new shit sell

Still feel like I got used

But dammit, I paid 'em
You jumped up when Funk played 'em
In The Tunnel and the radio station
No ultimatum nigga, ball or die
12 gauge on stage, seeing hands in the sky
No piece of pie
Goin' whole broke
Enough for a beef patty, Coke, a brand new smoke

It's some thugs outside thinking I'm easy pickin'
All I got is my Mossberg, so I cocked it
And a gun blast is all they heard
Hit the hallway 'cause niggas is still bussin'
Hit the doorway 'cause security's coming
Ayo jealous, living our life like GoodFellas
Niggas wanna see us out in the rain with no umbrellas
Rap's tryna sell us out, I remember the cops
Coming in my house fucking with my pops
It never stops
Got stoned out when I was young
Mom's cried so hard when she found that gun
On the run, you ain't the only one with stories like this
Nigga, my life is deep as the abyss
And uh
Had dreams of fancy cars and limos
And all I wanted was somebody to listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please listen to my demos
Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please

Now I'm lucky 'cause all my niggas is thorough
Talkin' 'bout all my niggas straight out in every borough
Been through some shit that some don't make it out
Been through some shit that send the flowers out
You heard about all the stories of drugs and killing
Who's dealing, blood spilling and drug dealin'
I know stories that live forever on those that died
But I'm here to sing a song that I'm glad I'm alive
Peace!
We rock on and
 rock the song and
Funk Flava visual Mack
Smack y'all niggas
'Tack y'all niggas
Uh huh

Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Pl-pl-pl-pl please listen to my demo

Shinika,B.I.G. Mack ,UnKnown,"Vocalicious funk flave 1-2 as we test this down
We get funk-stupid with this beat
Get stupid witht these rhymes I be bussin, yo
Yo 4-5 knahmsayin, yo, check it out
Y'knahmsayin, last night and shit, Friday
I was buggin out with the fellas
I caught up with this bitch n' shit right
I was like yo, check this out, so I started this
I said it's freaky-freaky Friday and I'm chillin on the corner
Hangin with my niggas makin figures that I'm gonna
Have the tunes blastin so fasten ya seat belt
Cuz AHHHH, blunted, I'm gonna make it melt
Had buddah in my head I musta smoked about a dime
When I seen this big behind, shakin like my rhyme, duke
I told my whole crew
I said ya busy hon but yo, yeah me too
I said my name is Mista Mack and I'm makin all the green
So honey you get vain and lets hit the scene
She said Mista Mack aiyyo Shinika's what they call me
Used to be from ?? but now I'm up in ??
I said Shinika, ya make my body weaker
You're boomin like L speaker and boy I'd love to freak ya
So I slipped my 20s to my man and hit the spot
Showed my knot, Shinika got hot
I opened up the door and yo in just a minute later
Had her snappin at my zipper like a hungry alligator
See, a sneaky-freaky MC is who I be
When it's time to step up inside a bitch's body
It's like that y'all as I kick back
On a funk track stupid phat plate y'all
1-2, Mack in the house
Testin one down with the funkalicious flave
Be bussin MCs like
Kickin wicked rhymes like Robitussin good for the throat
Cuz I hope ??? rhymes that I wrote
MCs clear quote
The funkalicious flave that I do with the 1-2
