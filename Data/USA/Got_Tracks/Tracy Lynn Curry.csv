All this time you been tryna be like me niggas

Cradle to the grave

I'm a shooting star , when you see me make a wish


Uuh
Ladies please hold your ?? for Mc'Cient
With that Bohchah on Ima real nigga
Man I say hip hop was ill till I the doctor
Brought the game a pain killer
Shit I'm the ruler
With me at the top is D.O.C
We never gon' jump and stump
Harder on the ground at ZCC
Bitch we streetwise like KFC
Prolly gon' lead this game for more than. A century like ANC
I used to sit at the corner on my street
Writing lyrics on my phone
Working hard away from home
Cause I love the mic as if its an ice-cream cone
I say that's what got me at the top
I'm never gon' drop
Cause I got this other rappers lips locked
Yeah I fucked , never sucked
This game though its a bitch
It got infected with the word rich
I'm now sick , from M.O.T.B
Cause I'm gettin Money Over This Bitch
Shit is real
So before I leave
Lemme ask you
As you looking at the top
What Do y'all see

I only see D.O.C niggas x3)",https://genius.com/The-doc-us-lyrics
1-2-3 (Critical Condition),Deuce,2003,"Whirlwind's ain't expose man a broken chance outta control
When they matter fact they broke 'em all
On parole comittin' 211's in broad daylight
New Jack city up tice nice
Makin' you hate life they had banger certified face wit yo' rangers
Cause soon the pain and anger decapitatin' strangers
Silent but deadly
Violence is my style and my recipe
Similar to a roach motel slide in but never leave
Drive in but never speed off, unleaded
Nas talkin' I ain't accept it and it'll serve you up in the second

Spin your body like records put a hole in the middle
Give my condolence to the family then expose it in pistol
When you comin' against the greatest
You should find out that I'm nuttin to played with
Clippers you couldn't fade and
Get him with the chrome plated

One, I pop up by the clip and load up
Two, I pop up back in now roll up
Three, put you on ambulance lyrically on the life support system

Spin your body like records, put a hole in the middle
Give my my condolence to the family then expose it in pistol
When you come out against the greatest
You should find out I'm nuttin to played with
Clippers you couldn't fade and
Get him with the chrome plated

Later don't move I win you lose
I'm payin' my deuce and ghetto nigga breakin' the rules
Hungry that'll eat you up, in the streets I'mma heat you up
Matter fact we gon' keep it rough
Brass knuckles that beat you up
Answer me this you bleedin' enough
With T-shirt winner, when I'm aggravated like a gupana
And incredibly run up in ya
Destruction in motion
Hold this somethin' this potent reloadin'
Leave you chest played open like chronic smokin'
Termination is my independence
To free myself dope dealers, broke niggas and you out for the same sinners
Prepare for the worst hope for the bad
Congratulations you mad with hers put four in yo chest
I ain't snippin' I'm livin' ghetto wizard straight out the prison
Niggas trippin' spittin' lyrical venom, put bullets up in 'em
Crease jeans and denim, street team offends 'em
I get in 'em, and break 'em crack crash, fraud within 'em
When you see us comin' better be 100 miles and runnin' when we gunnin'
You get done in
Skip the talkin' we dump 'em, 'bout time in Compton
Bass pumpin' and beat dumpin' adrenaline pumpin'
A nigga always into a somethin'

No half steppin', last weapon I had was a MAC-11
Clear the stage in matter of seconds, next get tested
You don't wanna no cause of this
Jumpin' try your cord of this
Straight out the clip don't forget I run wit who started this

One, see you roll down the block I raise up
Two, pull the triggers you niggas get blazed up
Three, put you in a ambulance lyrically on the life support system

No half steppin', last weapon I had was a MAC-11
Clear the stage in matter of seconds, next get tested
You don't wanna no cause of this
Jumpin' try your cord of this
Straight out the clip don't forget I run wit who started this

West coast icon, down south python
Spit on the mic and make it explode like a pipe bomb
Innocent bystanders go down like the top Titanic
Label it poetic justice like Pac and Janet
No escape holdin' the tre eight holdin' your fate in the palm of my hand
Tryna reconvert you to sayin' I'm corrugated
Stay at the greatest the ever bomb I fist up and bust you dead in the mouth for talkin' loud
Get it how you live it, twist you cap back and kill it
Gotta pistol in my brain so when I'm rappin' I kill it
Cause the corpses to feel it
Leave you blood when I spit I'm a thug to the critics
Say what's up if you wit' it
Cut up

Say hold up man
Stop the beat man
Let me catch my breath
(Say nigga what you doin')
Nigga tryna catch my breath
(Aight you got it)
Yeah
(Kick it)

Get distributed to the lion's pack
Don't make me put my nine back
I'm goin' out for dime sack rewind that
Similar to the police, raise AK's and sirens
We professionals in drama, competition and violence
Two one though, smoke it 'til your body explode
Turn yo the radio up as loudest as it go, drop to the floor
Burnin' you what's the motive the movement is locomotive
The environment is devoted so you die from a dosage
Highly ferocious I'm in control of this whole juncture
Makin' you lungs collapse through rap acupuncture
Pun, Big, 'Pac did it I'mma do over time
Designin' dope lines break down roll up and smoke my rhymes
Competition I just flame up another victim by way of the sound system
Have niggas comin' up missin'
Livin', unforgivin' breakin' jars when I hit 'em
Leave 'em submission

All In The Family,Deuce,2003,"I had nigga run up on me tell me one time man
Y'all niggas from the south is so laid back wit ya'll shit
You know he was tryna interpretate
You know how we do our thang
You know how y'all make that shit happen
I said look at this here
We just wanna live between the sky  the dirty away ya understand me?
That's the real deal all the freedom talkin' 'bout this DFW shit
This gorilla shit,  shit
Yo dog let'em know what your business is

Heroin, weed, speed, the yay, I want the power by any means
Several creams like Frito Lay
It pays to spread your hustle a lil' bundle won't hurt
Find you shoe
Put your foot in now put in work
Dolla dolla motherfucker is what I holla when I scuffle
This my block and attack then I box you wit my knuckle
Do you buck, cheddar chicken
Motherfuckers about my swip
I gotta pocket full of a stone and that's on the gorilla
I told ya money over hoes 'til the floor we up
These sluts don't give a fuck so I don't give a fuck
They good from bustin' nuts, but they ain't shieet
A bitch is still a bitch, so if you poor or rich
I went from pennies to the millennium, Benjamins give me them
I chased the big face, I'm tired of my wages minimal
This better be my time or result to crime pay
I gots to have dealer can't live without ya big face

All in the family, she yo freak my freak, let's keep it in the family
Dollar bill y'all, all in the family, all in the family
All in the family, she yo freak my freak, let's keep it in the family
Dollar bill y'all, all in the family, all in the family

Still do nuttin move but the money
Steady comin' for me, motherfuckers lookin' bummy
Can I have another hit, ain't that a bitch
Can you get a dime for 5, I got my nigga out six
Along way from rich, I'm blitzed, bout to hit a ditch
In my 80 joboritz, I miss
They ain't even with a Dayton, pump a kick
The bumps rollin' with my blunt, smokin' clunks
Punk bitch I'm throwin' g'z up
That's when they freeze up
Lookin' like hoes in front of they skeezer
Saint Jean you seen with a twist of lime then take the bam bam to your mind
Baby one more time, then ride like Ginuwine
Foot the gas sucka ass so I took off where I put the trash
Then match, money over 304
Mo' more over 304, but y'all don't hear me though

All in the family, she yo freak, my freak, let's keep it in the family
Dollar bill y'all, all in the family, all in the family

Still do nuttin move but the money
The greens, I want every penny, by any means
Sup, what's happenin'
Cream, tax free, proud to g
Our money earnin', so I'm burnin' currency
All in the family, let's keep it
You don't wanna shit start
My click G the deepest
Gorillaz and killaz
Fuck these hoes
Why she all up under me like Vogue, I suppose
It's the gorilla lifestyle, that I live
All in the family, for real, I'm in it like a splinter
Continue with the mashin'
Automatic fully when I pull it catch a big bullet fragment
Assassin don't make me get obituary
Our brand dash new
I'm a professional killer it's necessary
To dust and bust out
Just clouds of smoke
They said I did it black mafia style out the funk
They know, with no evidence no fingerprints no clue
Did I stutter man?
That's on the butter man
Dolla bill y'all all in the family
Get yo skreel toe y'all all in the family

Yeah that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about (yeah you are)
Yes sir, and we gonna do it like that
From now on understand me
Y'all do my deu--, 60 deuce of tight Cadillacsaville feel the mack
D.O.C

Kick it with me, oh woah!

I ain't tellin' you hoes no more let go my pants
I'm just tryna let you know the reason I came
I'm just really tryna lace you up on game
We party 'til we can't no more in this domain
It's your world playgirl so just do yo' thang
Can't nobody tell you who to sock it to
Shit I don't see nobody in here stoppin' you
They like it when I do that; tell 'em to strip
I won't even speak on what they do with they lips
Damn you look good the way you movin' your hips
Let yo' backbone slip, girl don't even trip
Look at this nigga showboats what haters be sayin'
I'm a macadamian nut they think I be playin'
I see me and you ain't on the same page
Hey little mama later meet me backstage
See 'cause parties ain't parties 'til we crankin' it up
We ain't leavin' this motherfucker 'til the sun come up
7-Up and Henny is what I got in my cup
We balla 'holics steady fuckin' it up

I like women of all sizes, bow legged wearin' disguises
G string located where her thigh's at
I provide the thing, know the black man dingo
Heavy structure so I swing low, and 'cause havoc
Me in the club gettin' sweated by broads automatic
Two one though all the way down your throat
Kissin' and pass it, dockin' up tight, watchin' via satellite
I'm hangover from last night hand out the kryptonite
Rewind my pimpin' money six foes and woman
I've been raw since the beginnin', 22 inches I'm spinnin' 'em (What y'all wanna do?)
Bang The Diggy Diggy Doc album and watch ya get remixed by Clue
Rollin' through residential neighborhoods, shatterin' windows
Movin' like smooth criminal, smokin' and passin' indo (What y'all wanna do?)
Put Dallas on the map before your U.P.-T.I.G.H.T. is critical

(You little prizzle is off the hizzle my nizzle oh fo' shizzle)
(And I'm about toss it DOcizzle, like candy)
I like the way you lick it baby
You got ya foot in this stock stick it baby (Oh really?)
Like mr. infinity, I could you fuck with my brand 
(Is that Jazze phizzy?, oh he must be crazy)
(He's got a 100 breezy, is that yo' lady?)
(It's the party of the heezy)

I'm start to finish
Don't even try if your heart ain't it
I'm from the dirty south, best believe we keep it crunk
I refuse to talk loud, and say nothin'

In the middle of the jungle
In the middle of the concrete jungle where my real dogs
Kick it with me, oh woah!
Here we come, here we keep it come come
Smoke some bomb ass sticky with me, hell yeah!

Chronic and indo
(He's totally throwed off)
Outspoken
Got bodies in the Pacific and they end up soakin' (indeed)
Over my papers nigga
Duct tape with no motion (believe that)
'Cause it took to get these hoes open (uha)

Blazin'
Front page slow roast
West side home of the jackers
'Cause some of these niggas is bad actors (not that)
They're fit to get you caught up in the raptures
But I just want the green like the masters
I'm watchin' how they do it ass backwards
My niggas over here collect platinum
You know my name nigga D.O.C. used to ride with the notorious D.R.E
It's overdrive for the y2k
Doc gave you the millennium look at how they feelin' us
I keep it rangin' from the bangin' to the sangin' on these fools

Now I'm payin' deuce 'cause that's play of the rules
You best to keep your ass on the ride
'Cause on the south side g's contemplate genocide
Termination's the number 1 component on that ass
Sho' make you wanna blast fool don't it

The south is on fire, 'cause I see smoke
Don't nobody panic ain't no one get choked
Whoever goes next I'm not really concerned
'Cause the south is on fire let that motherfucker burn
It's on fire, nigga I see smoke
Don't nobody panic, ain't no one get choked
Whoever goes next I'm not really concerned
'Cause the south is on fire let that motherfucker burn

Hit the block like Niño with Tony
Why you tryna hold me homie, I hit hard like the FED
Keys to the city I'm married to the streets
Who am I?, I OG as in gorilla comin' down milla
This fort murder ever hearda of a killa
You the realest I'm a whole lot realer
Sweat Cortez like a yoyay dealer
I used to hide them things in skittles
8-1-7 Mr. murder
Get you heard by agent J. Bergis
Excursions s of burbses
I know you can tell my click ain't hurted
You heard sippin' surd
The different aroma is kinda on your urge

The south is on fire, 'cause I see smoke
Don't nobody panic ain't no one get choked
Whoever goes next I'm not really concerned
'Cause the south is on fire let that motherfucker burn
It's on fire, nigga I see smoke
Don't nobody panic, ain't no one get choked
Whoever goes next I'm not really concerned
'Cause the south is on fire let that motherfucker burn

They nationally televise me on america's most wanted
The man with the most input but no cash to flaunt it
Broke down battered and bruised distributed in target
Sluts are mine just fine as I redefine your death warrant
Street talk, we walk, keep y'all, sleepwalkin', seen it all
The combination of end all killer I mean it raw
Swole after the goal
After hit that platinum changed my name
And my spray y'all niggas down I'm always blastin'
I'm corrugated malefactor no for score crackin'
Actually deceased with its exist I drive away laughin'
In the street covered in piss
I hear you chokin' and gaggin'
Lyrics vibrate your chest infamous for body baggin'
It's curtains when I'm flirtin' in fingerin' a trigger
The worst pain on a mankind I bring it to a nigga
Wit' an attitude throwin' out my CD like bare foot
Backed up against the wall lyrical homicide natural

The south is on fire, 'cause I see smoke
Don't nobody panic ain't no one get choked
Whoever goes next I'm not really concerned

It's on fire, nigga I see smoke
Don't nobody panic, ain't no one get choked
Whoever goes next I'm not really concerned
'Cause the south is on fire let that motherfucker burn

What it feel like nigga
The Stallone corleone, cash money number 1 stones
You know we do it bit down there
You know we got full nuts nigga
What's up Doc, I'm here to do this for ya homie
And we stay on fire nigga
We'll burn the world naw
It's all fucked up naw and it's gravin'
'Cause we didn't got money and power, I'll holla later

This is my prayer, my true confessions of my soul that evil deeds
But it was, perfect intentions though wit' twin brothers just really competitions, no
Reason to put my people through these changes
Lives wasted my friends are all strangers
And all along all I could think of was if I could bust
I know it's selfish on my part but still I hold trust
And hold faith, a whole state can help me find the voice I lack

Young Cadillac Seville the Mack
Me? Just call me DOC
The Mack Seville. tell 'em what the bidness is, my nigga

Imagine a young man saggin' who attract attractive women
A slap (damn!)
Just so happens that his Mac is converted to rappin'
His satisfaction when he serves up his lyrical tactics
Pervin' on, bumpy, place to place, an expert with masters
More scandal than when the deacon's wife flirts with the pastor
Hesitate when you see his face cause he's verbally badder
Chokin' on herb as he swerves in a burgundy track or two
Was on the curb, he can't turn but he's twerkin' the bastard
Free legendary and the words that he spoke
Young black with a skinny frame, got plenty game in him though
True trouble, some take and touchin' intended to turn him out
Willin' to work his words, roll the weed and burn it out
Inhale the herb (wait)
Then regurgitate what I've learned about
I'm the lyricist from the south with that mouth that you've heard about (that's right)
Walk in the club with clout, but before I pull my drink
Real foes, seven roads, hoe to hoe, shoulder lean
Now I do freaks for two weeks
Consume weed to do these
In two months (a new me!)
You too, Chron (ooh-wee!)
Truly abnormal, like the Elephant Man and Hannibal
I'm not an animal
Tell em again, shit!

Willie D told me to let these hoes be hoes
Not sellin' out, now none of my homies are buyin' bitches no clothes
Can't be seen with punk hoes and punch those that popper those
I got hoes, you never see me jock hoes
Hold what you got hoe, I want three soft tacos
My regal in in the shapos
I'm rollin' in vatos
The only thing to it is to hit it and scram, see?
Playboys'll be playboys god damn me

It's that cat that you make me chase
Is that nigga over there? Is he up in your face?
Handle your business baby girl, you straight
Just hit me when he leaves, straight lace no chase
It's a trip I kinda cut with her bra
Fuck her the next day, ass sweet, male dog
Sprung is what I figure she'd be
She did have a nigga now she fuckin' with me
You ain't know, true playas are picky
I fleed from the scene in corduroy Dickies
Got gang and I know how to act
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

Scorch them Dickeys in the grand Manhattan
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
I just wanna kick it wit' you, want it for realer
I ain't tryna come between you and your nigga
Just hit me on the hip and I'll call you back
You can play like I'm your kinfolk or something like that
You probably already thinkin' I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

I'm only out for breakin' you hoes for a phizze
Sevens up 30 Joes on your bizzay
Don't hide, divide your little Kit-Kat
Bitch, you know you wanna let a nigga hit that
I'm known to run game on most hoes
Don't hate me, I'm tryna get the pesos
Lay back, see Max never chase hoes
And as far as the bitches, see I make those
Indeed, bitch here with the weed
Oh please, I'm just tryna nut in your pussy and leave
It feel good but it hurt though
I get ghost on bitch, where my motherfuckin' shirt go?
Beat that coochie hole up in her moch
Lettin' you hoes know when I get you, I got you
Y'all remember me bein' true to the game
I gotta get it though, all coochie ain't the same

Scorch them Dickeys in the grand Manhattan
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
I just wanna kick it wit' you, want it for realer
I ain't tryna come between you and your nigga
Just hit me on the hip and I'll call you back
You can play like I'm your kinfolk or something like that
You probably already thinkin' I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

Do we know that it's me that call late at night?
Do we know that you a freak and ain't hittin' it right?
I ain't tryna come between y'all at all
What I feel is just lust so don't tell him 'bout us
Cause his brain is small and mine's is not
I'm still trippin' on that fine you got
If you don't look good, I don't
That nigga gon' get you stuck in the hood, I won't
I bet you think he love you to death but he don't
He ain't givin' you what you need and won't
You probably already think I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

Scorch them Dickeys in the grand Manhattan
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
I just wanna kick it wit' you, want it for realer
I ain't tryna come between you and your nigga
Just hit me on the hip and I'll call you back
You can play like I'm your kinfolk or something like that
You probably already thinkin' I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
Scorch them Dickeys in the grand Manhattan
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
I just wanna kick it wit' you, want it for realer
I ain't tryna come between you and your nigga
Just hit me on the hip and I'll call you back
You can play like I'm your kinfolk or something like that
You probably already thinkin' I'm hittin' your cat
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that

Just call me on the phone
When your man ain't home, I'll be there
Let's break you off, shake him off
Take it off bae, right there
Keep it on the low, low (low, low, low, low)
Ain't nobody gotta know that I be the  of slow
Keep it on the low low
Oooh! Ain't nobody gotta know, be that kind of slow

Scorch them Dickeys in the grand Manhattan
Same way of livin' baby, simple as that
I just wanna kick it wit' you, want it for realer
I ain't tryna come between you and your nigga
Just hit me on the hip and I'll call you back
You can play like I'm your kinfolk or something like that
You probably already thinkin' I'm hittin' your cat

Snoop Shit,Deuce,2003,"Oh, uh, D.O.C.? Without D.O.C. it wouldn't be Snoop Dogg. He put a lot of inspiration in me as far as being that superstar that was wit' me before I was a superstar that made me feel like a superstar. Enablin' me to write songs with him, to take songs from him, to help him with shit that we wrote for Dre together, to accept criticism from him, to critique his shit and critique mine, and... Man, me and DOC was like Batman and Robin back then for Dre. You know I'm sayin'? Wasn't nothin' we wouldn't do for him. We would stay up two and three in the morning at D.O.C. house, he stayed like 15 minutes from Dre, drinkin' Miller Genuine Draft, playin' video games and we'd stop playin' the game. DOC would go downstairs, I'd be upstairs. He got a cassette, I got a cassette, we writin'. We meet upstairs in about a hour and half, I spit my shit. He'd, like,  ""That shit dope but you got to change that part, that shit ain't out""
Alright, fuck it. But we changed that shit and make that shit tight. And had my nigga Dre's shit, like— I mean, we love Dr. Dre as far as, like we gon' write this nigga the best shit.

Souliloquy,Deuce,2003,"I see you two face but I'mma do this one for my father
I can't feel this, that is to say, although I'm not a coward, I feel like I been dying everyday
And if they said the crime don't pay
Then I must toss some price for me to have it so nicely
Lay it down for some row crown extincts with crime roll
Here comes the downfall
It's tragic but it's fair that's why it's called life and don't nobody care
Lord bless me
Help me understand the way you chose to test me
Or you see stress me deep as one may feel pain
To a minute meet so deep my god I can't explain
Although my friends around me say I know you can
But they don't know as I need you to hold my hand
Hey man, but if it is I have to get my due, just help me keep my focus and give it all to you
Play that for you folks CP

Dick too big, 'bout to tear they throat up
Ren give a fuck, you askin' to get cut

Drop this nigga shit, had a whole flame frozen

Niggas tryin' to run shit, pull a hamstring
I'mma do the damn thang, baby, do the damn thang

The kinda nigga that'd take Janet for granted
Ice Cube got that shit that you grew up on
Blew up on, got a lawsuit at home
It's a shark in the swimming pool
Bad news comin' through on them 22's
And I'm huntin' you out, little kids got to run in the house
I'm dirty like the South, with a gun in your mouth

Give a fuck if he got him a gang, he outta my range
Give her shit stains when I get brains, nigga

There it is, all right
There it is my niggas
We goin' back to the beginnin' of it
For real
But even in the midst of this old school shit
Our young gangstas still bring the pain
Doggy Dogg break them off somethin'

Easily I approach
The microphone with a pocket full of dough
The king of the Coast
I'm rockin' the boat
Strokin' your folks
And loc'in' with loc's
Baby boy got smoked
Nigga what up, nigga what up
I need cheese, paper, bread, and butter
Nut up and cut up the beef
I got a '44 piece that'll shut up the {​*gun shot*}​
My niggas gonna floss to this
My Crip'ed out homeboys gon' walk to this
Creep to the spizzot, and stash my knizzot
Then call the Dizzoc, you know we got it lizzocked
Pop right back on your monkey ass
Then cock the Glock back on your funky ass
Been a long time, I shouldn't have left you

What Would You Do?,Deuce,2003,"Number 1's it's Mr. Two Face The Bitch Killa
You know I've been known to get beside myself at times

It was a cold dark stormy night, similar to this one
The city stood still, and he was dressed to kill
Sportin' dickeys, and in Hi-Tec boots, picture that
Plus he muggin' the mean way, in the Green Bay, starter jacket and hat
What's goin' on in the city after dark, you never know let the story unfold
One of these lost souls was a female (what's up?)
Let me tell what had happened, drop the low down by detail
The bitch squared the game off, simple as that
I guess y'all still don't know that you can't trust no ho
I'm crawlin' down berry, made a right on miller
What was it, 1996 when 2Face became The Bitch Killa?
That's around the time I straight said fuck it
Last night on the news, they say a bitch was abducted
The ho was found duct-taped, that I know
They sexually abused her, and cut her throat
[Hook 1: Six2 & 
U.P.-T.I.G.H.T.
]
What would you do if 2Face came to pop ya? (
The heat of the moment
)
Number one component, pain got ya, (
The police can't stop ya
)
The church can't either, D-O-A in Fort Worth, that's where I leave ya
What would you do if 2Face came to pop ya? (
The heat of the moment
)
Number one component, pain got ya, (
The police can't stop ya
)
The church can't either, in the streets of 8-1-G, is where I leave ya

I went to school wit' him, shot pool wit' him, acted a fool wit' him
Drunk a brew wit' him, who'd ever know that I'd be losin' him?
Never hung around with street thugs, or sold drugs
Still, he caught three or four slugs and landed in the mud
Facedown, his mother came I seen her breakdown
From kilos, to OG's, when bullets hit the sleeve
Of his jacket, super magnetic, I'm never gone forget it
The pain embedded, retaliation is not suggested
Parental advisory, I want my mood the child provide me
Took him inside, ambulance arrived to get his body
Jumped in the 88, travelin' doin' 95 or better
Time to recover his Beretta, slipped in my sweater
Down to do whatever, buffalo soldier
Leather seats in the Oldsmobile feel like a sofa
Gun in my jeans, like they the holster
Comin' close to mental malfunction, continue punchin' the gas
Wonderin' if today is gone be his last
Don't even ask if I'm mad, got a ski mask
In my overnight bag in the trunk underneath the pump
In case I need to dump, rather beat the punk with bare hands
Aggravated glossy-eyed, I'm on the highway in a trance
Hit the service road, runnin' through lights, like they were all green
The thought of him inside a pine box was all I seen
Was it over green or a case of mistaken identity
Either way now they my enemies, I cut the car
[Hook 2: U.P.-T.I.G.H.T. & 
Six2
]
What would you do if someone shot ya main partner, (
the heat of the moment
)
Number one component, pain got ya, (
The police can't stop ya
)
The church can't either, puttin' in work for Dallas streets, is how I leave ya
What would you do if someone shot ya main partner, (
The heat of the moment
)
Number one component, pain got ya, (
The police can't stop ya
)
The church can't either, puttin' in work for 2-1-dope, is how I leave ya

Stepped out my house, stopped short, oh no
Solid black rag, wrapped around a .44
Had a money situation with a fool next door
Disfigured his face and left him dead at the front door
Won't hesitate, to annihilate a punk ho
Gots to get ghost and regroup in Acapulco
Police got leads, but they really not fo' sho' though
Suspect was last seen in como, showin' out
You shoulda seen him in his .44 Glock
Had his, enemies nervous, beggin' please don't serve us
In situations like these, I've been known to show out
He got his chest plate blowed out
Easily I approach
Your set in a jack mask, go ballistic on yo bitch ass
Y'all hoes ain't ready for 2Face
Been down since day uno, and ready to catch a case
Aggravated armed robbery is the plan
No need for skizzin', 'cause the clock keeps tickin'
So what's some aggravated shit without a pistol in it
The police say the suspects have not been apprehended
[Hook 1: Six2 & 
U.P.-T.I.G.H.T.
]
What would you do, if Two-Face came to pop ya? (
The heat of the moment
)
Number one component, pain got ya, (
The police can't stop ya

The church can't either, D-O-N Fort Worth, that's where I leave ya
What would you do, if Two Face came to pop ya? (
The heat of the moment

.45 Automatic,Helter Skelter,1996,"Like that, welcome to the brand new world bitch, put it on them like this, from the motherfucking home girl in the house to be new trip world and it’s the P-A-S-S-I-O-N

See I be flipping like Tina
Turning with a burner
Running through your hood yelling lyrical murder
It's dark outside and these niggas try to hide
I glide through your crew like glide to glide
I ain't letting shit ride
Watcha wanna do?
When I come for you and your bitch ass crew
Strap nine lose your mind on the verge of destruction
Blood starts to boil you like a lyrical combustion
Eruption it ain't no pressure no pain
Niggas falling off the strain the maintain
I got the cream team and gunning for the riches (riches)
So many wack bitches posing for pictures (pictures)
Everyday same papers
I regulate my papers, cause so many spectators trying to imitate us
They be walking by walking
Mocking my persona
They wanna be like passion but they don’t want the drama
They be killing me trying to preach to me
Teach to me, I got the p.h.d in funkology
You got your blasters and your masters of the field of dramatic attic
The lyrical one bringing the static from the attic
So cock your automatic I’ve had it up to here
You niggas are in danger you better stand clear up no love and notice mainstream America they just stay ready for this

Nigga didn’t wanna pass the weed
Left me stuck
Everybody be telling me Daz fucked up
But I never gave a fuck though
It’s all about the cash or you walk the river like trash
And I’m about to get a brand new
One puff puff it really don’t matter cause now I got the batter
Now sticking it in my sock
Jet straight hit the dope spot bet
No just us just me in Atlanta where you wanna come and test me
Real the real new whatcha wanna do
Cause all I got to say is all arcade
Put it another way of criminal
You could be the original mark of bliminal wiminal
Get wet
Can’t forget my niggas in the lake Westside project
On the line
Once upon a time in C.A
I met five niggas all they did was bomb shit
I mixed
The completely leet technique
Together with the knowledge of a Compton street
But weak Nigga fucked up mo town
One by one everybody broke down
I’m out it’s about money cash but me
I’m about to do a Jordan on that ass
Yeah one time for your mind do a motherfucker like that Mally G

I got my eye on the motherfucker coming out the back
Cause that trick bitch wanna see me on the track
And it’s so good that they want it like that
Cause I’m a Nigga bro
And kick the trigger flow
Screaming 6-1 to the grave
Big drug sellers
Bitches and money you can’t a motherfucking tell
Em a thang about this gang Philadelphia niggas got to let the gats bang
We come equipped with Glocks and flips in the pocket
And straight lock shit
And that’s the way it’s gonna be
From 95 until infinity Mally G
I beat that loony ass nigga landpin'
And now I give a fuck who the fuck
Is ???
I scream my shit I love my shit
Fuck flipping positive I get my living negative
Motherfucker it don’t stop ha and my Nigga erotic got it
???on deck what motherfucker
He got the track weed and the set
I drop it on the one for my dogs who was with me y’all
Keep it tight for a Nigga don’t forget me y’all
See I got my niggas and we got guns
And beats like that we always stay strapped
I represent the Philly four pound
Pack be quick to smack a tramp bitch jaw jack a felon like hard jack is flipping my thing down
With my Nigga erotic
What you want next
And the D and to the O-C
With the lunatic lyricist its mally g
The unfuck with the full individual
Leaving mc’s in the condition that will be critical
Ha and niggas know
That I don’t give a fuck about a trick ass ho
Never trick in my dough
And that’s the way it’s gonna be
From 95 till infinity its mally g",https://genius.com/The-doc-45-automatic-lyrics

I met this nigga look just like a fiend down on Martin Luther King
He told me he can flow he said D.O
No one could do it better than any flow I don't know
I watched him pull 187 on the world
When Cube put the flick did the other nigga go
Oh my, look I bet you see why

From Ruthless to Death Row (Do We All Part),Helter Skelter,1996,"That's fucked up, yeah yah
Hey!!!
Welcome
To
The new world
I'd like to make a small dedication tonight to the bitches of the world
Now to make this understood, I'm gonna explain somethin' to you
(bee-yatch!)
Check this out
Bitch!
To be a bitch, you don't necessarily have to have a pussy in your pants
(True indeed, true indeed)
In fact
Most, if not all, of the bitches I know (That's right)
Have little peckers, little dicks
And that's what they are you dig?
A bitch ain't nothin'
But a muthafucka that wanna come up
From another muthafucka (in the house)
Hard work
Don't make no sense to these muthafuckas
(baby girl) dumbass muthafuckas
To make it really really clear to I'mma explain it to ya in a story form
Like this here
Check this out

I remember the way it started
Once upon a time
When a nigga named Dre came, Diggy got signed
Ruthless nigga, everything was all good
In the shit, cause you rollin' wit' some Boyz N the Hood
No One Can Do it Better
, 
see, cause I'm an MD
And when I fuck it up, you give me 25 G's
Eazy-E said, ""Yeah, oh yeah!""
So I took it
Forget the paperwork
The money made me overlook it
I rose up quick from the pit I was in
450 0300 Benz
Nothin' but ends, money bought friends
Got me in a cross
Now everything's lost (damn!)
This is when I found out
""Look at this shit!""
You was slippin'
You ain't gonna tip for what that nigga did
""My shit fucked up, Dre, you need to look""
""I ain't trippin', yo, I think your little homie, he a crook""
The spot got shook, it was hell below
Is that the 
future shock
?
Hell, no, it's Death Row
I was all in because of the begin
Then they would say
Yo, we all gon' win
So ""The Chronic"" was upon us, the music awards
But I was still broke at the crib when they toured
The album soared and I got bored
With niggas talking shit, they came up on a lick
Ain't that a bitch?
I coulda been the star dude
Or maybe I shoulda stab out like Ice Cube
But what about your Dogg?
Who? Snoop? we was tight
I hung around, we'd get together when he'd write
In the pound that's the way it come together
When it's goin' down, niggas is in whatever
I went outside for a minute and came back
Niggas was talkin' crazy like they wanted me to rap
So I did somethin' from the old LP
""Damn! That's that shit!""
""That's what a nigga want to see""
Visit the Windy City and light keys
Rock over 17,000 G's
I recognized game
The shit was kinda funny
Fucked-up voice shit, nigga make money
He came back and here comes the glory
And this is the way I'm gonna end this story
I was only 19
Lookin' for a dream
From what I put out
I never got a fuckin' thing
This and the wreck was the fucked-up part
It's just a little somethin' about some real heart
From Ruthless to Death Row do we all part
Bitches, see ya

One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
Enunciate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothin' like an idiot, get it
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you

: Man you know every time a nigga involved with a white bitch you guilty

It was recorded on 11th June
Blood drips the groom excited
Only later to be invited
We went and saw the whole thing with false intent
Suspicion of murder
Sub quest for evidence
Residents eluded to a crime scene
Two slice clean
Now they got me in quarantine
The introduction to the white world, nigga
Cause you've been fuckin' with that white girl, nigga
They wanna see me with a murder case
My first mind check now I'm in a slow chase
To see my momma  but
When I get back to the cut
I'm cuffed up and fucked up now I'm stuck
I know who I know you know I do
But I ain't sayin' shit or they might get my ass too
And that's a problem nigga I'm on the brink
America justice look witness my killa instincts

: Say man you know what?
: What's up
: I shouldn't have done that high speed chase shit man shit made me look guilty
: Yeah man but you know, you had to get somewhere before them pep boys get after you. You know they was already out
: Yeah they was gonna make me
: Nigga they had they guns cocked muthafucker. Get somewhere
: Right, right. Yeah I don't know where they got the idea I was about to kill myself. Ain't no shit like that happenin'
: Before that happen I would've went out blastin' wit' you. Know what I'm sayin'
: Right, right
: Cause I got your muthafuckin' back
: I mean you know. Now they family trippin' you know other nigga wanna see my kids and shit. I been doin' that
: Man you want me to go over their an get you muthafuckers. I'll do that man

Now I sleep every morning some nigga creep
To my 6 by 6 position with the hammer flick sayin'
Shit like 'Nigga you'se a punk bitch all that runnin
You done nigga you ain't done shit
I'm escorted to a court room
Let the whole world speculate my fuckin' doom
Though I assume
Justice be a fuckin' joke
See they don't want me dead nigga they just want me broke
Nothing but perjury
Prosecution, illusion, confusion, dramatic climatic
Conclusion
Glove in the box fishin'
They don't like race nigga
So they wants to see a mention
Let's look at how they word it
Here it comes the verdict
What's up with me up in the penitentiary
The room quiet nigga
My mouth wide open
And I'm like damn! The motherfucker say I'm

: Damn man this phone gettin' ready to hang up man. Tell my family and my kids I love them man
: Alright I'll do that man
: Peace

(chanting saying, 1 9 9 99999 1 9 9 9999)
(water drop and evil laughing)
As I submit the new world grows in
Six, I cover myself with lamb skin
Black family, five point to win
Then again, Prophecy, watch the Vatican
You must begin to think, sit up
And you can see all 22 was lit up
With the Skull and Bone
Picture what is known of the Scroll and Key
Of the D.O.C

Yeah, yeah
I have a secret plan
New world connects the next man
Other hand, the one fake god
Light, Neophyte
Spit on the cross from a pit
And I look and I behold a Pale Horse
Forty-Second degree, mind in the source
Originally from the brotherhood
From the beginning, but you never could listen
Hey Cat, kept undercover, another rung in the ladder
Six got hung by the Beast
Looking for the Golden Fleece
With shackles
Look at the jackals scream Peace
To a ring to fill
Death come quicker when you shoot to kill
Watchout!
Bloody Mary, sleep with your gun
Show me the sign innocent one
The end might come
Now whatchya gonna do
Knight
Be too cocky not to get it all right, so
Who shall save the human race, none
Six thousand, erase, replace
Replace!, replace!, replace!, replace!, replace!, replace!, replace!
There be our/a power, so organize
Look for Brotherhood
Make light disguise
Symbol of who arrives
For thousand years to pass, remember
Religion is but a tool to control your ass
Reflect for when the millennium connect
Esoteric enlighten-ment of the elect
Reflect
Come face the Order
Witness the illogical manslaughter now
Follow the Master, Supreme Degree
The new world girl found death at 33
That’s 13 levels above thee I see
Deal to never reveal the real keys
To the esoteric language
As you enter a brand new age of anguish
Pyramid
Police turn my niggas into thieves
No matter, six thousand delete, repeat

Repeat!, repeat!, repeat!, repeat!, repeat!, repeat!
Repeat!, repeat!, repeat!, repeat!, repeat!, repeat!
(Sirens, gunshots, breaking glass, screams, and laughing)

Momma I don't want to die
Mind crawl
Circle complete when they creep the cat claw
Alien, secret unto the ages
Pour out some liquor to the dead sea pages
Knights! History hidden
We forgetting from where the Book came
Brotherhood of the insane
Slay
Humanity you can not identify thyself
I sign and pray
Sign, hand over forehead
Countersign pyramid, eagle wing spread,hey
Luciferian, totalitarian, socialistic, twistic mind
So when they bail
Holy blood, holy grail
Historically, they don't want a nigga to see
Try that and we'll be Dunkirk
Political murdering, do the gun work
Chasin'
To replace the hell
Into a jail cell
Society, don't want you in they clientele
No matter, six thousand we blood runnin'
'95's the beginning, watchout
It's comin', it's comin!.., it's comin!, it's comin!, it's comin!, it's comin!, it's comin!, it's comin!, it's comin!.., it's comin!..

America is now under martial law
Stay in your home
Do not attempt contact with loved ones
Insurance agents, or attorneys
Do not attempt to think or depression may occur
Stay in your homes
Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp, after work
Anyone caught outside the gates of their
Subdivision sectors after curfew, will be shot
Remain calm
Do not panic
Your neighborhood watch officer will be by
To collect urine samples in the morning
Anyone caught interfering with the collection
Of urine samples will be shot
Stay in your homes
Remain calm
The number one enemy of progress is question
National security is more important than individual will
All sports broadcasts will proceed as normal
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission
Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor
Be happy
Obey all orders without question
Be happy
At last, everything is done for you",https://genius.com/The-doc-secret-plan-lyrics

Drop the lyrics, a'ight

One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
Enunciate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothin' like an idiot, get it
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough

It's funky, it's funky 
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place

If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo, I am not a jackass meanin' not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
Brothas say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitchin'
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the C
When I'm P-E-R-F-O-R-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I am dope
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style that I am using
Knowin' that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hittin' funky enough


Dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it

Listen to the kick, drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowin'
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am jokin'
Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this, yo Dre you must stop him
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static cause that's all I need to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say, Dre yo you're getting funky enough

Deal with the D-O to the C

I need a break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sittin' down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And I'll kick in the beat to give you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer
Heaven sent if you’re a hellified dancer
You tried sittin' but it just won't work
Cause the beat is so fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough


And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy",https://genius.com/The-doc-the-madden-re-match-lyrics
Beautiful But Deadly,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"(Intro)
Ayo Stan, Dre laid the tracks, I'm laying the vocals
We need some guitar that ROCKS, know what I'm saying?
So um, let's do this
(Verse 1)
She's a rich girl, but not the ordinary
Extraordinary, a little too much to carry
Possessed by a demon on a mission
No man alive can refuse her proposition
From this fantasy, but to me she was more than
A bad dream, she was a nightmare for man
Took her sex appeal and she taunted
Twisted the brother until he did just what she wanted
Disregard the laws of the other man
Sacrificing the plight of the brother man
I'm not the type to let a woman make me weary
But to resist, he'd have to be a fairy
Nothing that a brother wouldn't want to indulge in
Drives a Porsche and her purse is bulging
Her body in the form of a romantic medley
But be warned, she's beautiful but deadly
(Verse 2)
She's all about the bank roll, you can tell by the gold
Eyes deep enough to engulf your soul
She's like Medusa, but you won't turn to stone if you watch her
One fatal look is all it takes and she's got ya
On your knees and no more to spend
And you're still thinking how you want to see her again
It'll be difficult, but boy it ain't no joke
Saying nothing going on but her rent and a car note
You're wondering how in the hell
Little knowing you're the reason that she lives so well
Guessing so hard you'll submerge her attraction
But she go so many, son, you're a subtraction
Now you roll like you're crazy
Attitude is send down with being spacey
Never will I let this stupid bitch get ahead of me
I know the scoop, the bitch is beautiful but deadly
(Verse 3)
She'll keep you mystified like a swami
For you to slow her down, you'll need an army
Of a thousand strong brothers with a gun
But if they're careless, then they're done
She's an animal not to be taken lightly
Once she has a grip and squeezes tightly
You're in line for such a wonderful kiss
It'll cloud your site like the morning mist
No compassion, the minute after you're a slave
Breaking the law making sure she's paid
Yo, you oughta know the girl you see at every concert
She's in the back with the tightest dress looking the best
Know what I'm saying? You have to do like my man Cube
Tell the females that ""I Ain't the One""
Cause if you don't, regularly you're back doing it readily
It's all to keep up the pace with someone beautiful but deadly

I got big ass lay law in the house
Told me to make one for the motherfuckin' white boys
So I made this funky shit here for your motherfuckin' ass
I got my boy Jiggy Jigg in the house
Big ass Dre is in this shit as well
Dr. Dre go out there and motherfuckin' shit on this bullshit
So if you white boys don’t like it
I’m gonna send Dre to beat your motherfuckin' ass

You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowin'
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am jokin'
'Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this, yo Dre, you must stop him
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static 'cause I sold an SMG to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say, Dre yo, you're getting funky enough

It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
Deal with the D-O to the C

I need a break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sittin' down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And I'll kick in the beat to give you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Perceive, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, 'cause I'm delivering the answer
Heaven sent if you’re a hellified dancer
You tried sittin' but it just won't work
'Cause the beat is so fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough

It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
It's funky, it's funky
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy",https://genius.com/The-doc-its-funky-enough-lyrics
Lend Me An Ear,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"A little bit better than dopest
A brand new kid in showbiz
With knowledge I persevere
But now do me a favor...

Lend me an ear
And we can find the rhyme to fill in space
And drop the bass with a taste of light
Lyrical perfection, see I'm equipped to um
Open your mind like a Christmas gift
It's '89, the new school is needed
Originals, see nobody can do it like we did
The D-O to the C, yo, a deuce not a trio
Me-o, mi-o, spin a chump like a gyro
Hard, dangerous, suckers angle this
Cut is raw. Why? 'Cause they can't hang with this
Loop the break and I take a second to rock the rhythm
And stay smooth like a prism
A 
Portrait of a Masterpiece
, 
It's Funky Enough
'Cause Dre told me it has to be
A little stronger, so I make not a mistake
I'm too much on the hype tip, Dre, break

Circle an answer, it's a multiple choice
Who's the kid with the golden voice?
A, the brother upon this song
B and C, I don't know, but that answer's wrong
Pure simplicity, it's the D-O to the C
Most incredible, unforgettable
On a mission, the man kids want to be
Like, but sike 'cause I'm one in a mil
Hype producer, creator, maker
Making it now but I'll do it for you later
In the mix Dre put his hands on
(Scratching) Now that's a hell of a song
I show and tell what should be told
And say it with conviction and proper use of diction
So that it's easy to understand
(Who can do it better?) Huh, no one can
'88 is gone and the old year big shots have graduated
In other words, made it
So it's a new year to start a new time
You need to know what's on my mind
So lend me an ear

Hold the riff, sucker, 'cause we don't need that
It's so outstanding that my mic don't feedback
Break, you're broke, he got up and forgot
I drop science and put his neck in a knot
For trying to hold who can't be held
So the punk records jam, I don't give a damn
I do it in a different class, so what's up?
You wanna break? You're all the threat of a buttercup
As knowledge coming, I'm coming never sleep or slip
I fall on the serious tip
Stop and stutter trying to think, your brain is soft
Words are clogged in your throat, you're coughing on
The boss, straight from the South
Word is bond from word of mouth
So let the nation be hip to the fact that I'm the great one
Until I sung, no damage done
Peace, a dream we all dream together
Dope together forever
In a nation of one rising, showing no fear
Yo, lend me a motherfucking ear",https://genius.com/The-doc-lend-me-an-ear-lyrics
Let the Bass Go,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"Together we witness one of the most delightful in our times
So um, let the bass go
Nah, it's got to go a little lower than that, Dre, drop it!
Nah, it's gotta go even lower than that, you know why? (Why?)

You've been denied, although you've tried
So I've intervened to make you fall like a tide
No disappointment, cause my beat'll soothe like an ointment
Suckers with static approach and get smoked like a joint
Feeling ignites the flame, I mean I burn like a lighter
But with a hip-hop groove cause I'm a writer
The hero or great, take a stand then we'll see
Thee, in chronological order starting with me
A rap introduction, the suckers destruction
Yeah, are all involved when I started conducting
The lyrics are the maximum, I stated for facts in them
Chumps never try to break knowing I'd wax them
Murder in the first degree
Occurs only when dealing with the D-O to the C
I'm like a whirlwind pyramid, and I'm letting you know
I get ill when I hear the bass go
Yeah, that's the sound and you know it's down
But you know why? (Why's that?)

Cause I've been around, and you've heard the sound
Of the DOC and the new style that I've found
It's quite unorthodox, but still bass and
Enough to make you dance, so I picked up the pace and
Let it ride like a cyclist
And see it show in the end that I'm the mightiest
And that I'm lyrically inclined to make you want to step to my time
The beat and the cut to this rhyme
Do a show, and I'm good to like a G-O
Never getting skeezed, I mean it's like an N-O
Happiness to me is like a positive cash flow
So I let your ear cold hear when the bass go
(Kick it over here...kick it over here)
(Now I think it's about time) (Feel the beat)
(Drop that) (What?) (bass) (Aight, bet)

I don't wanna (stop), cause if I do you might lose it
I made this record for you to jam, so use it
Kill the treble, pump the bass and then
Send the suckers on the block into a tailspin
Roll by, booming like a nuke bomb
I know there's pressure on your ears, but stay calm
After you pass, though, you better turn it down some
Or else you're gonna put a dent into your eardrum
Success relies on the individual
I feel successful when receiving the residual
But as for you, you all should know
When I say ""Let's get hype"" I'm letting the bass go
Now that's the way it should be done
I know that's on the one

And that is fun
To see a sucker standing weary
And girlies on the tip standing near me
The bass was the topic so I dropped it
Added some dope lyrics and then I locked it
On track 24 in a machine
To make you move on the hip-hop scene
Cued up Dre, and I knew that he would know
That on the one, I would let the bass go
Because a dope jam is what I gotta make
I make it rattle cause you love it when it vibrates
The D the O and to the C
Must cause pleasure when showing y'all my ability
To inject on the set mass enjoyment
This is to ensure definite employment
When I hit town, yo, you'll know
Crowds will roar, and you'll hear the bass go
Yeah, let the bass go
This is most definitely down with my homeboy DJ Speed
Is that on track?
Word em up, peace",https://genius.com/The-doc-let-the-bass-go-lyrics
Mind Blowin’,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"This is serious business
*Scratching ""The Doctor""*
Y'all ready to get hyped or what?
Well, right about now 
The DOC and the Doctor
Is housin' the set center stage, pumpin' it just like this...

A little somethin' for the brethren
With intellect to truly understand it
It's like a message from the one who's gettin' candid
Makin' a mark on the strength with rhyme ain't like nothin'
When you're pumpin' something that's bumpin'
Did it, 'cause it's like I had to make one
Better than the last one, 'cause a mistake, none
But something new was needed in the mix to
Make it as lethal, so lethal that I would think you
Couldn't be made to invade certain areas
No other jurisdiction, but that was fiction
As you progress, and you're enlightened
And the better you're writin' by never bitin', you're excitin'
To the crowd, club, congregation or gathering
Homies in the street they'll be thinkin' you O.G
Smooth, wordy example of how I'm livin'
A kid in his prime pumpin' records that'll blow your mind

The DOC is dope
I would've been down with rock but I'd be broke
By the punk, I'm openin' up my trunk
To reveal, death, livin' it up, my life is like a story
Yellin' it, 'cause nobody else is tellin' it
Checkin' it, always gettin' paid 'cause the rap is sort of a twist
Between what you need and what I mean
What I mean by twist, now you gotta listen
Never a segment in negative
'Cause I’m employin' what you’ve been missin'
So in total, this is one of the many styles of an artist
Hard it may be, but not my hardest
Just a portion, cup of salty water in the ocean
Rockin' it was the notion, it seems I needed a potion
So I asked the Dr. D-R-E could he comply
Lookin' at me with a grin, he shrugged his head and said ""Why
Would you ask me a question
Knowin' you knew the answer all the time?
I make the records, you kick lyrics that'll blow they mind""

The DOC is lookin' for a dope beat to lay in somethin' melodic
After thirty seconds, Dre looked up and said ""I got it""
Like the dope sound rollin' with the dope beat
Made me rock a dope rhyme, which was simple 'cause I'm
Equivalent to the greatest, nobody knew before
'Cause I just decided to make myself apparent once more
To deliver to you an order, let's call it a system
A brother tried to play me like a kid, so I dismissed him
And now I'm ruthless by keepin' the crowd groovin'
It gets so rowdy that you swear your chair's movin'
But it wouldn't, it couldn't, it's more a feeling you encounter
When you're rockin' to the music of The DOC and
Dre is on the cut so be wary of all movement
But whatever you do, take the time
To enhance the record by makin' moves like smooth
And I'll keep pumpin' lyrics type of music that'll blow your mind",https://genius.com/The-doc-mind-blowin-lyrics
No One Can Do It Better,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"(No one can do it better) (Repeat 3x)

This is to listen to, so ask not a question
Not to be taken as a simple suggestion
But a warning, to whom it may concern
If knowledge is the key, then I think it's time you learn
For there is not the problem
Some leaders are acknowledged, I don't follow 'em
I turn into another degree
And find the D-O to the C and growing like a tree and
Causing much destruction because I'm crushing
Complimented much, yeah, but never blushing
Hard like a criminal, and I'm subliminal
In my own right it's dope cause I'm original
Funky, unmistakably so
When the vocals are done, then you know
It's all a matter of setting a date
For America's most complete artist, but wait
Make sure you keep the facts in mind
Don't mess with The Great, cause the Doc is like a nine
With a voice, telling you the bullet's direction
I'm talking murder, but that's another section
I need to explain while keeping my composure
There's no jerking a sucker when he knows you're
Nothing but a villain, and you'll kill him
So he's in fear, but there ain't no need in spilling
Your guts to a nut, no, I am not your equal
Meaning your equivalent, I'm more like heaven sent
I got it together so clever no one could sever
Remember this forever
(No one can do it better) (Repeat 3x)

Knowledge is the key, and hard work is the fee
For me to be The Great at the start and remain to be
A threat, til the opposition is warned
Taking as long as a song, cause I was born
With instincts to kill, a grave mentality
Over the edge and you say you want to battle me?
At your own risk, approach and be hosted
And in the end you may win or be roasted
But seeing it's part of a game, you think if you hang
Close to The One and you'll claim, but that's lame
And I'm ""Damn, another loser""
Without an apology, so next time I'm a use a
Little more force to get the message across
It's The D.O.C. on the boards
Creating, demonstrate some relate to easy listening
But here's a christening of what you've been missing
An exhibition, a new hip-hop introduction
Smooth lyrical gab and I do the conducting
Drop it on a rhythm, suckers face it
But new to the masses, it's like I'm starting classes
Better bet I understand the direction
In which I'm going, in fact when I'm flowing
The news is a constant change from one minute to the next
I'm different cause I always show flex
And it's essential, that's why I got it together
To the letter and
(No one can do it better) (Repeat 3x)

I need to make it understood, The D.O.C. is not a hood
Not at all, though I carry a weapon when I'm stepping
I'm not a murderer, not in the sense that you're accustomed
I buy in the system with suckers smoothly bust them
Opposition is taken and that's a quote from the Doc
And the Doctor cause this ain't no joke
So if you smile, here's the outcome:
Your teeth are gone, your mouth is numb
Don't get involved, unless you're willing
To risk murder by mic 'cause when they're illing
You gotta be weary, watch for cautious, yo, be warned
By Dre and out the project born
Capable in any and every
Cause, yo, I get heavy, when introduced to a medley
Such is the case before the bass started wompin'
I had to hook up with the boy from Compton
Searched and found the sound then accepted
The job of making L.A. well respected
Of course with the help of a gang that's Ruthless
Peace to the homies as I do this, what I mean and
MC Ren is in the house, Ice Cube definitely in the house
DJ Yella, Yella cold with the hoes
And Eazy-E is stupid chilling 'cause he knows, yo
No matter who's badder I'll be the dopest forever
By kicking lyrics so clever that
(No one can do it better) (Repeat 5x)

Time is taken to dedicate peace to the homeboys
My homie Laylaw, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Eazy-E
DJ Yella, Fresh K, MC Smooth, my homie T-Low
And of course without a doubt, the one and only
My DJ Dr. D-R-E most definitely in the house
Peace to those homies and I'm outta here",https://genius.com/The-doc-no-one-can-do-it-better-lyrics
Portrait of a Masterpiece,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"Yea, c'mon
C'mon, yea, c'mon
Let's take a trip but not of the physical
Sense of direction on a kid who's artistical
Through a gallery of thoughts, of course it's dope
Hangin' tough like the name on my rope
Watch it be weary instead of steppin wit the boys
A musical massacre of inadequate noise
By the new authority cause of majority
Of peers who hear will award superiority
To those who know you knew now it's inevitable
I laid the track and it's simple unforgettable
Time had hold me better than gold, I sold
And in front of a group of soul is a new episode
So like see if you can grab a pawn yet another one
Take it to the everyday like it's done the son
Words connected up to another degree
And I'm the artist who painted this portrait of a masterpiece
It's unquestionable
That lyrically, the D.O.C.'s a professional
Nothing exquisite to prohibit you from listening up
Crisp and clean but I don't mean 7-Up
I preside ill dippy dope to frantic to panic
And just a man on a mission wit something more in the attic
I'm just an ordinary, boring very few
Do it to the mic, is the D.O. to the C., you
Made the choice that doesn't need to pretend
I’m on the ascend, not knowing where the elevator ends
But anytime between I'm spending
Play it strong, write it like it's never ending
Keep creating while suckers are hating me now
Keep the upper hand cause the respond is gonna plow
No one can handle the physical torture
I've been taking and no matter what, I'll support'cha
Goals and dreams although is seems it won't come true
All of that is up to you, yo
But if you can't handle
You need to jet, cause rap's like a gamble
Basically outspoken, keeping them choking on
But you recall, yo, a helluva rap song
Doing it forever together wit Dre, it will never cease
Money and records like ""Portrait of a Masterpiece""
Now I'm exceptional
Instead of the norm, walking and holding my testicles
?(swoon for a six)?, spell out what it means to be dope
The D.O. to the C., they can't cope
Deal the real, yo, it's better cause I had to be
Better than any cause of majority
Negative never, I'm all about a positive force if you recall
It's the D.O.C. Yo I'm the Boss
Rap much greater, Dre up on the fader
Pump the bass and the pace
Most like by the D.O.C and this is it
Cause when it's hype, then I feel that it's the shit
Word, never would I stop, I drop the beat I will
Especialy when I have to kill
I'm an annihilator, standing a full 6' 3
And I really don't think you wanna deal wit me
Why should I go...
 Hold on Dre stop the beat, let me catch my breath
 Aiyyo man, why ya stopping that was funky
 To catch my breath
 Alright you got it?
 Yeah
 Kick it
Strong blowing kisses to the wind
The D.O.C. in fact to attack the wicky wack
And take the rightful place at a rightful time
The D.O. to the C. and it's mine
Move, cause no one's gonna take my spot
It's new and improved, why? 'cause it's the diggy diggy D.O.C

The D.O.C. and the Doctor,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"Yo Dre let's kick it on the one, black, and we don't stop
Making records that people are cold checking and respecting and
It rocks, the sales won't stop, those of the Doctor...
And I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all, pumping it yes y'all
D.O.C. on the set we're kicking fresh y'all
Letting the bass G-O and full with soul so I can wait
Leaving the rest to DJ Dr. Dre
It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
When I hear a bass drum, I gotta get dumb, but some
Think it's a fable and label me not able to come
Correct, so I cold jet back to my room
And invent something to compliment the boom
Of a kick, cause I want it all like in Monopoly
The great make not a mistake, make sure it's properly done
Strictly for public satisfaction
So you're in awe when I'm in action
Cause all we do, from me to you, is a song
Strong, bump intention tumping system is born
I deliver, somthing to shiver you peak level
And if you want it deep, yo Dre go get a shovel
And you're bumping, your speakers rattle
This is all over the world, but without a saddle
Light the twice, I hype the mic, make it dumb
And Dre is the engineer, but I'm the drum
It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
I want you to turn up the radio, listen to the lyrics
And I let the bass go so you can hear it
Bumping, your speakers are thumping, dig it, yeah you like it
You know the album? Get it
And I'll keep producing and inducing
A rhythm with a style that makes you get loose and
Sweat, cause I'm as good as you've gotten yet
Some said they can handle, you wanna bet?
And I don't understand the misconseption
Think that if you make it, you go in one direction
When you're in flight, yo, you gotta fly high
So you were born, so you die
It's all evolution, here's the rule
Evolve, my meaning, enroll in a new school
Adn learn the tricks that makes the mix dumb
Then be certain to keep suckers hurting when it comes to a drum
It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
Yo! And now your eardrums are cold full of the big beat
But you're attatched, like ankles are to feet
So you listen, and as it play you pump it louder
But to your speakers you're sparking some gunpowder
Check it for a second, listen and behold the
Great as I open your mind like a folder
Down with the science, I'm rocking like a musical
So when you're listening, you're seeing me and
Dre cold sweating cause you know we're like striving
For number 1, not number 4 and number 5 and
Nothing can mean more than to make it last a lifetime
In the middle of his mix and my rhyme
Never been in need now that Dre is on the cut
You may think I speak of music but I dream of coming up
Rolling to the homies in the city getting dumb
The sound of the D-O to the C and the drum
Yo, it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
Dre, drop it, it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
Is that a yes y'all? (Repeat 4x)

The Formula,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"High energy flowin' with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
Nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
And I fall into the state of mind of what I'd just created
Pump it like the Dr. D into the R.E. suckers ready to leap
Up on the tip when we made it
Creative so I'll never be regarded as a regular
More than just a little bit better than my competitor
You should never underestimate the fashion
I hold for the stage whether I'm coolin' or thrashin''
Clockin' the concoction created by me
When read you read E = the D.O. to the C
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals an artist that won't be worn, what is that Dre?

It's the formula

It's like a message that only I could understand
But those who want to comprehend will again
Be in the midst of the brother
Unlike another in any way
Cause Dre don't play, say what the other say
Originality is a must whenever I bust
A funky composition, it's crush and I trust that you
Know it when you hear a funky record with potential
Me gettin' hype cause Dre rockin' the instrumental
Nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
See I don't Fess, I mean I'm like fresh if not the freshest
When I'm expressin' my thoughts on
Vinyl, you can't help but listen up and get caught on
Hooked because I cook when I pick up a pen
And begin, in the end it's dope, that's cause I want to win
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals the DOC, what is it Dre?

Yo, man, that's the formula

Keepin' it dope as long as I can like imagine
Makin' each record that I do better than the last one
Take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
Release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
Rhythmic American poetry
Shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
I'm the D. into the O. and the O. into the C. and the C. into the period
Suckers are fearin' this
When heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
And take just a second to get caught up in my record
New but not a kid to be worn
If something gettin' torn up then I'm doin' the
Tearin', not bein' torn
Shapin' up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
And when you hear of this
You shouldn't choke on this
Knowledge and the talent makes it valid
For me to get it patented
Dre, tellin' what I'm rappin'

The formula

In effect and I'm smooth, that's why I'm on the incline
Suckers frontin' for nothin' cause I'm goin' to get mine
It's in the cards and I think I might have read this
So don't lie and try to front like someone said this
Most who know thoughts served by the DOC see
That it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me
For an arena who'd ask me to perform for her
G.O. and easily I flow and ya know usin' the formula",https://genius.com/The-doc-the-formula-lyrics
The Grand Finale,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"Check this out, we've come to the last and final record
This is Dr. Dre in full effect, and we gonna kick it off a little something like this
We got my mella Yella boy on the drums
We got Stan ""the Guitar Man"" dropping the rhythm
We got LA Dre on the keyboards
And I want the whole posse in this muthafucka to rock on this funky ass beat we finna drop, aight
So Ice Cube, you the early bird on this muthafucka, run it!
[Verse 1: 
Ice Cube]
Picture a nigga that's raw
Amplify his ass and what you see is what's on
Motherfuckers I slaughter, blow 'em out the water
Word to me, fuck the father
My medley is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
You can't throw me, I guess you'll blow up
Ever see a sucker scattered? It'd make you throw up
Then I take advantage, you can't manage
To get up, all you can do is sit up, I get lit up
Hit up, Ice Cube tear shit up like a dude you can bet on
Collide like a head on
Collision, stutter stepping is an incision
Of a nigga saying exactly what I vision
Because I'm gone, you think I left you all
But I stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
When I blast, I'm solid as Alcatraz
And if you escape, you better swim fast
'Cause I'll catch ya, physically and mentally
And the capital punishment's the penalty
Sit in the electric chair, grab a hold
Pull the switch, your body twitch, your eyes explode out your skull
'Cause being dull on a flow is a N-O
Niggas didn't know that I can go
Off and show off to throw off the law
Turn, take 10 spaces then draw
What's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
Ice Cube is the shit on The Grand Finale

Yeah, yeah that was funky
But now we need the muthafuckin' Ruthless Villian to speak
So kick it

The Grand Finale, yo, it's my turn to bust
So let weak muthafuckas turn to dust
If you're weak, it ain't your fault
Just take a kick in the ass and get turned into a pillar of salt
And niggas that bite me just to taste me
I make the punk muthafuckas buckle up for safety
And those that don't, they caught from the flash
And swing like a bit when he's caught in a whiplash
Giving him pain 'cause I'm urgent
Rearrange their muthafuckin' face like a surgeon
It ain't no excuse for the torture delivering
Don't say you're not scared, yo, I can tell 'cause you're shivering
Lyrics label wit an X and not a G
I said ""Fuck the police"", yo, so now they after me
I'm wanted by the law so I stay low
Representing the pimp while bitches make my dough
In a different stage, I must've went on a rampage
Me and the Doc are always hitting the front page
For one, the Villain is stepping up to the shelf
And when I enter the party, niggas shit on themselves
And for what? Maybe 'cause I'm Ren
And when they clean up their shit, yo, they do it again
So fuck it, sit back cool and relax
While Eazy busts the facts kicking The Grand Finale

Yeah, y'all know what time it is
Eazy muthafucking E is in the house doing damage
[Verse 3: 
Eazy E
]
They made it Eazy for me to come off like the enforcer
Mass murderin' muthafuckas in a course of
An everyday situation where I would stalk by
Fuck a car, I do a motherfuckin' walk-by
Eazy-E and the D.O. to the C. and
Run house and yo there'll be no disagreeing
'Cause if there is some, you feeling staticy
Then I'm arrested (For what?) assault and battery
Never outdone, only outdoing
Loving the bitches and leave the hoes boo-hooing
Why? 'Cause they're addicted to what my dick did
The pleasure and pain the wing-ding inflicted (Yeah)
They'll never forget what's done in bed
By Eazy, the name of a Compton hard head
Cool, but loco like Loc never broke
'Cause it pays to be Ruthless, this is why I do this
I don't give a fuck about fame
I rather deal with a number than a motherfucking name (word)
Get me paid and then rap
'Cause all that other bullshit without money ain't jack
Eazy but not that easy to deal with
Especially if you're poppin' bullshit
The E-A-Z-Y and to the E
Expression of thought on the motherfucking Grand Finale

Yeah, that shit was funky
Last but not least is the muthafuckin D.O.C
This is your album, so that means you definitely got to get funky, so run it

Swinging, singing a brand new rap
On a rhythm concocted by my homie in the back and
If it makes you giggle, it must be kinda funny
But to me it's kinda cool (Tell 'em why), I'm making money
Tripping off the man wit the swift hand movement
Proving if you're grooving then it's cool when he be doing it
Taking a second for me to 
blow your mind
'Cause I'm the diggy diggy Doc and I would've been down with rock
But I was smart, 
the D.O. to the C. knowin' the formula
It's rough, 
I mean it's funky enough for me
And you can have a listen, helpin' and some dissin'
D-O-N-T M-O-V-E yo without permission
From the D.O. to the C., I'm just better than
The normal man and I'll be damned if a sucker can
Ever compete with the elite, much less speak
It's like dancing with two left feet
Never smile when the Doc is in the room
Or I'mma send ya ass right to the Temple of Doom
I got raw when I came to Cali
Now I'm wit N.W.A. on the muthafuckin' Grand Finale
[Outro: Dr. Dre and 
D.O.C.
]
Yeah yeah, that shit was stupid def
But right about now, we gotta send a shout out to everybody that helped put this muthafucking project together
That's word. Word em up. Peace is dedicated to the homeboy Eazy E
, Ice Cube, 
MC Ren

And these are all the homies from the gang NWA, yahmsayin

Whirlwind Pyramid,No One Can Do It Better,1989,"They said it was all about knowledge
And know I feel like I got most of it all
Dre, drop it!

Parental discretion is advised when The D.O.C. gets candid
To move like a one-armed bandit
Arrange the tempo when I go solo
The beat and the cut to a rhyme, and it's oh so
Raw, cause you want to jam, then you go ""Damn, he's good""
And you're right, cause I am
And I'm strong, strong enough to reach them
They said they wanna learn, so I'm a teach them
Amplified by a microphone, my point is known
So yo, leave the pad at home
I'm down with the sound so much that I can feel it
If there's a deal to be dealt, then I'll deal it
I'm on a roll, that's word to the father
Chumps want to break, but I tell 'em I don't bother
Char the memory of all who saw the
Last of the concerned, I burn like lava
So in sum you break, you broke it
And I'm smiling, but not joking
Secrets are told, fold but never did
With the knowledge as strong as a 
whirlwind pyramid

Whirlwind pyramid

It was mandatory, a righteous editorial
Cause my sport is like part of a memorial
Knowing the whole, I was told through a pole
I have the juice to make vinyl gold
Servant at your service, never nervous
Why am I claiming The Great? Cause I deserve this
Title is vital, I receive directly
So I don't have to deal with suckers trying to check
T-R to the A-Y, do they have to be warned? Just try
And I'll start crushing without discussion
Checking the crowd with the rhymes I'm busting
Cool, a quality I have to mention
Gaining with the dope comprehension
I move the crowd, so I make it my bid
Pop the lid, yeah, see a whirlwind pyramid

Transform

Hold it, you're a step off the pace, so catch up
And if you're sittin', get your black ass up
Dance to the rhythm, let it move your pants
And if you don't dance, I assume you can't
And as the crowd, steadily expanding
So move, 'cause I don't want to see you standing
You're in the way, so hey you gotta step
Left right, I don't give a damn, just jet
As you leave the party in the light you can see body
Everybody, but you're a toasting Maserati
Cause you don't want to handle the scandal
Physical abuse cause you're as drunk as 
Tony Randall
And it's a gamble, I mean I've heard you ramble
On and on but you get worn like a sandal
They said, ""Get raw"" and I did then I slid to the back
And hid behind a whirlwind pyramid

The D-O-C, with some help from 
my boy T-E-E
Is now operating smoothly
Original knowledge of the whirlwind pyramid
Big dollars I'm gonna always clock
And I'm always down to rock
I had some gin and Sacco (I think you're drunk)
Now I'm ready to rock-o, ha ha ha",https://genius.com/The-doc-whirlwind-pyramid-lyrics
Pineal Gland,UnKnown,1989,"Intro: ""You wanna' play rough? OK. Say hello to my little friend!""
:
My stomach's so full from all these rappers that I fucking ate
I'm going insane, I belong in section eight
Someone let me out my cage: what a big mistake
You guys are weak like paper plates, selling out like real estate
And I'm fucking higher than a shooting star
So ahead of my time, I'm on Mars driving flying cars. Ha
I keep you moving like momentum. Try to take mines, I'll pull your spine out your rectum
Now my cranium is heavier than gravity
I'm dissecting instrumentals like anatomy
Niggas mad at me because I took their baddest B;
What a disappointing tragedy but that's just the reality
Hatting ass niggas tryna shit on me
But them hating ass niggas ain't got shit on me
You can feel my energy when I step into the facility
Like mathematics, fucking with your mental balance and ability's
:
(Uhh) Turn the volume up 'till your speakers pop. Doing what I love to do best when the needle drops
This Hip-Hop trophy, Ima take it. But before I kill my mudafucking flow, Ima rape it
(Yup) This is do or die or suicide. I'm getting high; that makes my vision vaster than the bluest skies
Get throwed 'till I pass out. Leanin' 'till I black out. I'm shooting in her basket like that nigga Jerry Stackhouse
:
I'm oldschool, like Walkman's and tape cassettes
Killing rappers mad slow like cigarettes
The hottest nigga in your town, I don't fuck around
But I'd fuck around and probably bust out with the dopest sound
I put my spirit in my jams, I'm going all out
Listen to this sober, and you'd probably think you bared out
Hennessy to the dome 'till I'm out of it
I do drugs but I can't say that I'm proud of it
I gave it to your lady, left that pussy aching
Then wake up in the morning to the smell of eggs and bacon
The beat go hard, but my flow is much harder
Cause tryna' fuck with me is like tryna' breathe underwater
Suckas' act suspicious? I'm getting mad vicious
Cut a nigga nose off if I find it in my business
My dreams are pretty vivd, this is how I live it
Getting higher than the sky cause their is no limit
:
(Uhh) Turn the volume up till you go deaf. I'm the flyest eagle from the mudafucking birds nest
Everything that I write cause casualties. Now I got the mudafucking devil coming after me
(Yup) I'm killing these rappers and put 'em to sleep. Leave 'em deceased with these treacherous beats
Try to compete and you'll swallow defeat. So gather around, let me have your attention
Here to teach your ass a lesson, in every rap session
:
I see dead people in my mudafucking dreams. I see dead faces where there not supposed to be
Could this be fantasy? Is this reality? ""All that we see, is but a dream, within a dream."" (X2)",https://genius.com/The-doc-pineal-gland-lyrics
