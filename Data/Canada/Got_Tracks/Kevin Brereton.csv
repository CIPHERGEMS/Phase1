On The Run (I Wish I Knew Natalie Portman),Yes!,2009.0,"(k-os)
I'm on the run, for my life
It's seems that everything that you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you ever thought you've done your best
When you were under the gun, that's right
I know I've seen this place before, but it's never been so fun
Never been so fun
I've been on the run
This Shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No I can't really make you love me
(chorus)
I've been on the run
Shadow weighs a ton
I know I found a recipe, for me
But I can't really make you love me
(Oh no, you know I)
No I can't really make you love me
(Saukrates)
You know I'm haunted on overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebenezer
I made them see the ghost
Back from the future donned in Japanese kimonos
Even though the streets show love to try to see me grow
I often see me floating, but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage
But I can't make you love me
This time it's on you
And you can't try to deny, these words when they're true
I'm on the run
(chorus)
(k-os)
Let's gets a steppin
Your tongue is like a weapon
This is Kheaven from heaven and yet
So are ye, since the age of seventeen
I've been taking apart microphones
You've been taking apart men you've blown
And throwing skeleton bones
In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you needs a woman's glorious diamonds I'm a defeatist
Carry my fetus
I'm like the man in the moon, when we kiss then you swoon
On the run
(chorus)
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me",https://genius.com/K-os-on-the-run-i-wish-i-knew-natalie-portman-lyrics
The Love Song,Joyful Rebellion,2004.0,"Contrary to popular belief
You know what, yo

This is not a love song, it's a sonnet
Damn it feels good to have people up on it but
I'm just a fool playing with the master's tools
Learing how to break the rules of this record company pool
Hallucination, I see with my eyes
But my heart's telling me lies, why do I fantasize
Why am I telling lies to the people from the stage
Pretending it's all good when inside it's fire and rage
Cause I can't understand
How a man lives off the life of another man
Trying to pimp the universe, that's a joke
I stay rocking the boat down to my last note
It's murder she wrote, assassination vocabulary
I see your termination is heavily necessary
I should'a known, they do it for forbes alone
I do it to break the walls if I fell off then let me know people

It's funny how life can go
First you ride high then you might lay low
Don't get high off your own supply
Someone said first before a fall comes pride
This is my message to the world
Just trying to reach every boy and girl
Not trying to say if it's right or wrong (you know what, yo)
This is just a love song

Lyrical optometrist with twenty-twenty vision
Servin' rhymes like my granny used to serve provision
Chaotical amniotical fluid, the rap jewett that's fluent
In the art of onomatopoeia
Metaphysical microscopic topic dropper
When I was a kid I wanted roller skates and a bike chopper
But alas, pop, pop, never thought to keep me in style
That's why I'm schizophrenic now so
God bless the child that has his own
The harvest we reap is what we sown
Chrome microphone, shoot it, towards the dome
Of computer digital clones, that mimic philosopher stones
Saying the style's their own, when they bite like mike from brownsville
That sounds ill, relationship is a mirror
But ch'ya see yourself within, and the picture is clearer
That's why I'm on the scene wit a mic, like ernesto guevara
While they exploit your life like geraldo rivera, they just

It's funny how life can go
First you ride high then you might lay low
Don't get high off your own supply
Someone said first before a fall comes pride
This is my message to the world
Just trying to reach every boy and girl
Not trying to say if it's right or wrong (yeah)
This is just a love song (check it)

It's easy not to care, what people say
It's harder to pretend to try
Cause they can only love you, from yesterday
I'm looking at the nile, it rose high
I'm just a man who's walking
They stand around and keep talking
They tried to clip my wings
But wisdom fills so many things say it again
I'm just a man who's walking
They stand around and keep talking
They tried to clip my wings
But wisdom says so many things, to love, love

It's funny how life can go
Don't get high off your own supply
This is my message to the world
Not trying to say if it's right or wrong
This is just a love song",https://genius.com/K-os-the-love-song-lyrics
Crabbuckit,Joyful Rebellion,2004,"It's high now
So low it's high
Like this, check it out yo

Took a trip on a bus that didn't know
Met a girl sellin' drinks at the disco
Said truth comes back when you let it go
Seems complicated cause it's really so simple
Walkin' down Yonge Street on a Friday
Can't follow them, gotta do it my way
No fast lane
, still on a highway
Movin' in and out, no doubt there's a brighter day

No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket

It's like this, It's like this...
It's like fly in a room, scream, writing on walls
Swear this clone been havin' a ball
Claimin' themselves just before last call
Tic-a-tic-a-toc, tic-a-tic-a-toc
Clock strikes twelve, clock strikes one
Smoking gun put these fools on the run
I know it's not that simple, I know it's not that hard
Where's your goal?

No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket

Yeah na I mean
Yeah, I heard you man, yo, check, yo, yo
It's a 
conniption, fit when the microphone's lit
I take it higher like a 
bird on a wire
, 
retire the fire
I'll never cause I'm just moving on up
Choosin' to touch, the unseen, craving the clutch
The most inevitable, legible pyro-mania
Slaying the devil, and send him back to Transylvania
Strangely enough, I avoid that side of the ghetto
From my heavy metal, will settle the puppets like Gepetto
Damn, if mirrors where created by sand
Then I'm looking in the water for reflections of man
Understand the minds above time when it's empty
Emcee, 
tragically hip, ahead by a century
, rrahh

No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket

Man I Used to Be,Joyful Rebellion,2004.0,"I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Awe baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the surface of truth I hid 'em
This mankind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that taught to walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene


I walk the long path alone, my feet hurt
Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
I went to church, I tried everything
From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth
Rappers are acting like man tan
Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got Kheaven acting frantic
I wanna swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyone me
So what is reality, I don't know


Oops, wrong song, stop it stop it
You know what
I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But i'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen
Holla and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Yo, microphones get ripped holding us back
K dash rocking it out, rocking the cold style
Making it up, go along singing my song
Woke up, in the early morn didn't know what was going on
Whatever, I don't really know
Flows like an immaculate goat what up, whatever",https://genius.com/K-os-man-i-used-to-be-lyrics
One Time (HainesVox),BLack On BLonde,2012,"Intro:
One time, I give em one time
I give em one time
Verse 1:
Watch to choke and don't bust
Got the juice so don't bound with us
Rock a faith, but don't wear things down
Rock a boat but they're landing now
Cheat things up, but don't die for the mill
Rock the truth and go home fulfilled
Back in the days I would hunt for the full, the blunts, and rip the mic at McGill
Just get down, one time
Try taking just one step back
Choking, smoking, macking lacking
Causing witchcraft blow, black
I choose the facts
Make a hit, then coast to coast and come back
You thought rap was over, but thank Jehovah I'm back
Taking over year, yeah beat that
Hook:
One time, I give em one time
I give em one time
Verse 2:
Forget the past and lets hang
No need to blast or gang bang
Lets be real because life's too short
Told ya girl to absorb them thoughts
Kick the truth but don't die to be right
Then again I like how you fight
Back in the days I would come over to your place from exchanging latex all night
Ye-ye-ye-yeah, one time...
Baby just take one step back
When I met you girl I stretch you, wet you
You twist the facts, make it seem like you and I are not back
You thought we were over, but thank Jehovah we swag
Kick him to the curb, lean back
Hook:
One time, I give em one time
I give em one time
Bridge:
Youre just another lonely girl
So who gives if you run the world
Youre just another lonely girl
A lonely girl, yeah
Verse 3:
Back to the middle, to the front, don't front
On the style that was made, to be quiet and played
Like a child with a new toy, this is dope boy
Never know I never did coke boy
Used to drink Jag, chug it back till I yak
When I rolled with a pack of wolves on a black chop (Now I'm not)
Keep it reverential like my Pop, you can say I like to cope like Spock boy
Our solar system is floating through outer space
We don't know our own face
Won't act like a human race
We strictly wasting our rhymes
Thus wasting these young minds
Realize you are human kind, lick a shot one time!

Faith,The Anchorman Mixtape,UnKnown,"Pay attention, its on
Staring at my city lights through the plane window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
I’ma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Ain't much change since high school
Niggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new CL5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause I'm out in California in the studio with Tez
You should give us credit niggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them niggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB,
 call jaz, call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us

Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds

Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin city’s innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again it’s an even odd
Can’t applaud with one hand
Can’t be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I’m on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down
I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there’s no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Mind that gotta race
Don’t be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don’t get got just get God yeah see that

Time waits on no man
So when people fall like me

Everyday is Saturday night, but I can't wait for Sunday morning, Sunday morning

Pictures inside my dome

Hurry up, wait

Superstarr Part Zero,Exit,2002.0,"Subtext
Today, in the year 2002, the cultural artform called HIP HOP has been
Desecrated by false profits and ergonomics. It's all very strange:
Emcees want to be rockstars, and rockstars want to be emcees
Obviously, we're all posing
Just like blues, jazz, and other African musical tradition, HIP HOP
Has been diluted and presented to the mainstream as a vehicle for
Money, fame, and power. Everybody wants a piece, taking but never
Giving anything back to the culture
This video is dedicated to HIP HOP, as a voice for those who are
Physically and psychologically oppressed. Lo and behold, the
Universal Law of Cause and Effect is swift and true, and those
Who have manipulated will reap what they sow. Still, at this
Time the state of HIP HOP is enough to make an emcee go crazy
Here is a Story of one who did
Intro
Yo the year is 2002
It's the end of the jiggy era
People on the planet Earth are tired
In an effort to aid a great shipment millions of bodies incarnate (GET UP!)
To rock mic's
Complex, this hip hop alchemy
When I was a kid I watched Electric Company
Now I'm all grown living life to the bone
New tone, spaceship take me home
Back to the seventh sun the seventh one
When I drop patience, Kheaven's done
This eloquent vernacular is black enough
To bring a change to Dracula
Uh, I'm hitting them with synonym adrenaline
Then I send em up into the kingdom of the heavens
A matter of time before this rhyme
Infiltrates the bloodstream into the mind
Of a man living a life in Babylonia
I'm lonely as she went to California
Frisco, hypno's, get clothes
Crystals, taking it back to the raw rap

(You, you blind baby. You're blind from the fact.. oh yeah cause you're
Watching that garbage!)
(Chorus) x2
Ooh I love this girl
She's a superstar
You can change the world
You're a superstar
Okay, here we go. Verse two
Yo, I got lyrical shots aimin at 
T. Dot
Telling me that you are, when you know that you're not
Uptown, chilling at the corner store
Thinking, ""Why the hell do I front, I'm hardcore""
Like Castro, master flows pass the golden links
Whatever you think its all old, you get it?
Whatever the cost I will not floss
Emcees actin a boss they all get tossed
Off the plank
Hold the dank I don't burn
I got a lot to say but really lots to learn
Turn, baby you're just not concerned
Whatever earned, thinking of the most high earned
I flip with this some hit, some miss
Don't get fooled by lyrical ventriloquist the twist
Most flee I'm Krishnaji
Come back to flip rap
Do it to crowd; make 'em clap
Superstar, superstar, superstar
(Chorus) x2
Ooh I love this girl
She's a superstar
You can't change the world
You're a superstar

Spraying My Pen,BLack On BLonde,2012,"Turn the lights down low and listen to the masters radio
Get in touch with God
You're sittin' on a fence, you sit on a wall
Wasting time and you're trying to stall
But when the bough breaks, I tell you, my friend
I'm comin' downtown and I'm sprayin' sprayin'

Whether Rock-A-Bye, or Humpty Dumpt'
Ain't no apprentice, I'm Donald Trump
Get money, get money, I don't succumb
Stayin' in my lane, on a hundred meter run
My Usain Bolt, my insane quotes
Yes, I stay close to my enemy
No it ain't you; You wish it was
It ain't nothin' but time, so far you're a friend of me
Backstabbers, smilin' faces
I'm da Vinci with a pen and pad, go 'head and trace it
Picture yourself with all my tendencies and platinum bracelets
You still a bitch, I hang you with my bitch's tennis anklet
Beggin' my pardon, pardon my French but I leave you starvin'
You jivin' turkey, I'll let you watch while I'm turkey carvin'
Gone 'til November, dismember you while my guts enlargin'
Lookin' for sympathy, no empathy, shit, you a nigga in the wrong department
Next stop is the purgatory, let the universe choose while you're waitin' horny
Got my bread, got my bitch, not my house, can't pay to call me
Hang up the phone, I'll page you when you can play again, with a major pimp
Ain't talkin' 'bout hoes, I'll say it again
You fuckin' with a made man I'm sprayin' my pen

Sprayin' my pen, sprayin' my pen

K-OS and Sauks can I gatecrash
I just heard a couple AK's blast
I'll pull out my pen and spray cats
I'll pack a whole novel, my Great Gatsby
Ready to spray 'em if they gas
No facemask, I do it asap
Me and K dash, we laid back
That's my anchorman, we stay classy
That pen game, that stage craft
You know I'm crazy with it no straight jacket
That crazy cake, I don't bake that
So I don't waste stacks on no Maybachs
See I take the cash and I save that
When I make scratch like I'm A-Trak
And we blaze rappers, y'all rate that
That's slang from the place where I'm based at
It's where Drake's at, it's where I pay tax
It's Van city out to Ajax
And Montreal out to H Fax
And we learn, y'all, I ace classes
I'm old school, like way back
Dwayne Wayne glasses, no face tats
No save as, just ADAT
Y'all say good night when we say blat
No graff paint but we spray that
Me, Sauks and K-OS slay tracks
No graff paint but we spray that
Your body shows we slay tracks

Sittin' on a fence, you sit on a wall
Wasting time and you're trying to stall

Sprayin' my pen, sprayin' my pen

And they love you too
But uh
Cataclysmic with a gold Bic
I'm a mystic lemme know quick, where my girl at?
Is she LA, in the New York
Is she back home, Forest Hill, I heard her new man's wack
But of course cause he ain't me
All the rappers on the block try to paint me
But they can't see, cause I'm livin' in the water
And I'm comin' in the form of Krishna Murti
I'm not worthy like the human serviette
Damn girl, I wish I was your cigarette
Cause you zig-a-zig-a-zi so tightly
And I'm bad for your health but bitely
So, cause hip hop is punk rock
And it just don't quit and it don't stop
And if you mess with ? and Saukrates
Then Shad-K's gonna spray and you'll get dropped, hot
Nobody's gonna stop our rise
To the top cause we rap like crop
Circles of the alien race so face the facts
We gold from black with platinum plaque
? Don't stop, get it get it get it when I hit it
I remain committed to walk her for a minute
Down to split the atom bomb, analytical
And I did it, split it with Glenfiddich
Wow, we're so alive
Dip, dip, dive, socialize
Tell no lies, Kevin Brereton
Like rap's Al Iverson, I'm the livest one and Poseidon's son

Sittin' on a fence, you sit on a wall

This is Crucial, yeah

Would I come back to love you girl?

What you say? Come again now
Nothing left to do but let it burn
I only hope we're all ascending high

What you say? Come again now?

They tried to chop me down
But the truth shall not forsake me
Take me up to higher ground
And you-ou-ou-ou-ou

You're pretending the game is a race
Because you're born and you die'll in my heart

I don't wanna change the world
I only want to stop pretending
What you say? Come again?
What you say? Come again now?

I will never let you down
I'll be right here beside you, hanging around

I-I-I swear, I know, they are in the boat I row
E’rrybody in it gotta paddle, muthaf-cker won’t let go
I done made a hundred thousand dollars every season I was on that show
I’ve been told I was next by a legendary that was on Death Row
It’s a secret, I’ma tell ‘em, rappers only claiming they get paid
I’ve been gettin love in the club ever since a nigga came in underage
I just put Patron in the pineapple and I do the same with lemonade
Let my money flow through the air, I can make it rain on your parade
I can do it, I can do it and I know the rumours get around
I’ma take my city to the top and then I’ma never let ‘em down
I’ma show a lot of people love, I’ma give ‘em credit where it’s due
Anyone that got it I can do it, this the one I dedicate to you

Let the heart palpitate
Let the soul just astroplane
Here’s a secret, let me tell ‘em
We’re the ones that started rock n roll

Me ET phone home, BET play my song
Had faith oh so long, thats why we both flowed on so

We got to let it go
We were too deaf for wedding bells
And too naïve to know
Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
The dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine
Go ahead, go ahead with your better self
We'll go in love with somebody else
Sometimes it's better to live in sin
Than in love when you don't want someone to win
And now the sun is setting well (setting well)
We got to let it go (let it go)
We were too deaf for wedding bells (wedding bells)
And too naïve to know
Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
The dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine
Malibu, Prius drive
Who took who for a ride
Wild fox, black boots
More shots, half truths
Easy come, easy go
Yoga mat, Yoda flow
Canyon road, Hayden's house
Turn me up, fake me out
Birthdays, little word
Spare keys, insert
Argument, ecstasy
Don't stand so next to me
Computer screens, swallow us
Look at all my followers
Everybody get down, I'm taking over
Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
The dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine",https://genius.com/K-os-the-dog-is-mine-lyrics
Diamond Sky,BLack On BLonde,2012,"Yeah, time to throw caution to the wind
If it boomerang backs hard
I'll just locate it again
Never click my friends, I'm good to flick my ends
Ust take my bag and attack and a booster rap
And it's goodness when I blend I'm singing
Matt Bing it I bring it in sick subject rap (hope ?? like this track)
7 planets set me back, my brain is C3DP0R2D2C3 we coupe with you we cool we be the truth
We be the deepest rocking crew
Cruising black blocks when I break it down
My town it shines like the diamond sky
And I make it sound, let me get it
Don't try to get it, don't take the joke
When you hit the block and you did it
First you not the facts
Now it's time to take it back 'cos
I'm going back where I started from
And when it goes down
I take it back where I laid it down
(hip hop never stops, never stops)
Whoa, oh, it's so physical oh, so
Living in this new world order loco
Jobe, search for the hit about to go go with no chick
And glow, like Jehovah my spirits never sold
I am now with it, sitting pretty with platinum blacks plaques
Acting all self loathing when I'm feeling nothing back
Fat stack, hit it grin and flag it pony poop but you almost had it
Go great now, drop my sound, dun dun dun de de de de
Crown, and I'm not not not not chasing blatant bling
I simulate these words make it dope and float on angel wings
So bring the king of Kings, something that you can't hide hide
Cheers to the whole world
Hope for dope and then hope it float your side",https://genius.com/K-os-diamond-sky-lyrics
Spaceship, Can’t Fly Without Gravity,UnKnown,"Like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky

Uh, stare out my window
Already know where I been though
They say life's like a stencil
At twelve years old I rock with a number two pencil
My mom used to say ""get your head out the sky""
Such a small fry, they didn't want me to fly
But I never cry, I just took a step
Peace to Josh, peace to Droops, less we forget
Yo, slanging raps on the block, just to lick a shot
Other rappers aren't hot, just forget it
Right down to the bell before class
Every other one dimension emcee wouldn't last
Mister Stally, where's my demo?
He said to let you know, let the truth be your ammo
Yep, another song to sing
And they soon come back bringing the dawn they bring
But...

People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie

Yo, it visits one time, there's only one line so you better be on time
Sifted the black in the back with the track
You could cruise in the Cadillac 'til they put the zap on 'em
You're not a friend to the end, you only come around when love is a trend
It's a spaceship, not a slave ship
And until your eyes spent so many wasted
Nights in a hotel, go tell it on the mountain
Oh yeah, mansion in public housing
It's a different kind of bouncing, from a distant star
But you all meet me at the bar

People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie

This is not speak and spell but I ring the bell
You could tell that it's astro-Johnny Cash flow in an Astro van
Kicking rhymes in the back to our final destination but it's not on the map
You attack, but it's a little known fact that I'd rather shoot stardust when it's on tap
This is dealing bigger claiming love at first glance, so think about a quote in advance, dance

No lie

People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie",https://genius.com/K-os-spaceship-lyrics

That doesn't mean you were born to run

As sure as the stars in the skies above
We're going back to the place that we started

We fell from sky and universe
When we fell in love with the sound
Of the birds and all the ocean likes
And the gravity pulling us down
Time won't let you go
There are some things you'll never know
I'm hoping that she walks through the door
I'm in Love
If the sky would fall
Will it take that to bring us together?
Do we have to start all over again?

And excel past the so called body
Used to go to the party
But now I sit and chill with the pen and the pad
Dropping ill philisophical science
Me and my dad we talk about life
And how it started
How we departed from lights path
And probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that we're not who we think we are
Within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be getting high wondering why we die
But it's all planned
To get your fear take the hand
We keep on returning because the lessons need learning

I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analize

Microphone autobots waiting on lotto spots
Trying to rock

There's only one plan
The time is at hand
In the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to free the righteous children
Now! I know you want to be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl watching your jacuzi swirl
Seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust

Everybody wants to scrutinize
Redifine who you are
But every person is a star
So let your light shine far

I think I'll just stay...

A B-Boy, standing in my B-Boy stance 
A B-Boy, standing in my... yeah...

From the top of the highest summit, again we run it
A hundred and forty-four shimmering lights stunning
Too quick for the human eye to catch a glimpse
You know pimps cannot convince with bigger attempts of MCing
Blowing word to the wind
While we ascend to limit the sins and pretend
We're still human, when in fact we're only half
The other path extends infinity do the math
I try to laugh, but 
they pull me down like crabs in a bucket
With hands in my pocket, how long will it last?
Heaven only knows

 keeps inventing the flows that turns black pros
To white foes...You're just supposin'
Have you heard my words moving at light speed and getting blurred?
It's all so incredible, decibels at a glance standing in my B-Boy stance

This one leads the way...

Break
Break
Now cut it up, cut it up back to back
On the wheels of steel
, cut it up back to back
Break
Elevate, Meditate, eliminate
Thoughts from my past keep knocking upon my gate
Shouldn't let 'em in, the answers not to debate
But to observe the debating and then we can understate

Yo party people listen up at the drop of dime
They took cameras to africa for pictures to rhyme
Over old...yes, the great pretenders
Religious entertainers who want to be life savers
Damn...another diamond from the mine, another cold secret hoping
They can't find, they can't copy or get pictures with no lines
I guess it's just a case of the blind leading the blind
But, I'm flipping and stepping and rocking the roll, taking control
Paying my tolls, who's in control?
I'm playing a role so people will remember that
I'm just a servant of rap, hoping to bring it back

This one, leads, the way...

Break

I'm just a B-Boy...
And it brings me joy...
I'm just a B-Boy...

I'm just a B-Boy...
And it brings me joy...

But then you turn and walk away
All for love
Not even born yesterday
I see you on the streets
And you just pass me by
You think I got no feelings
Think I'm living high
But let me tell ya
I could be on the TV
I could be in them magazines
But it's never enough
When you felt the touch
Of an angel that's rocking your soul

When the rain comes down
You're never around
But when the sun comes up
You always steal the fire
And rain comes down
On this side of town
But people have no feelings
They just run around

They just, they just
We keep chasing dollars
It's making me holler
I just don't know
I don't need a check
I need some respect
So people you know
And the war
And the babies crying
And the car
And the house
And the rings
And the things that don't mean nothing
You could try to hate
Cause if I am right your right down
But I'm here to elevate
I'll be floating in outer space now

When the sun comes up
Will you always steal my fire?

Has come undone, lost my sight

I know. I've seen this place before
But it's never been so fun
Never been so fun
I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no
I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no
You know I'm haunted on overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebenezer
I made them see the ghost
Back from the future donned in Japanese kimonos
Even though the streets show love, try to see me grow
I often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage
But I can't make you love me

And you can't try to deny
These words when they're true

Your tongue is like a weapon
This is Kevin from heaven and yet so are ye's
Since the age of seventeen
I've been taking apart microphones
You've been taking apart men you've blown
With throwing skeleton bones
In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you need a woman's glorious style, diamond to fetus
Carry my fetus, I'm like the man in the moon
When we kissed and you swooned, on the run
I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton

Nyce 2 know ya! 
Verse 1:
I live inside your head just like the day before tomorrow
And spending most our lives recalling things we already know
I tried so hard to steal the sky and call it heaven bound
At times I feel like I'm alone like the new kid in town
She said I need your love, that's what she said
She said she had to break the mirrors that exist in her head
I often wonder if I could keep you compromising things
But then I feel the heat and wind beneath these angel wings
Hook:
Nice to know ya
Can't believe it's almost over now and you just wanna let me go
Nice to know ya
And when I look up at your picture I see somebody I ain't seen before
Nice to know ya
Cause every time you talk about it how come I'm always the last to know
Nice to know ya
Even though you don't deserve me cause you would rather close the door
Nice to know ya
Verse 2:
I'd rather run then work this out
You're like the sun cause you burned me out
Ain't no time to waste
I already had my taste I gotta find another way
You and I go in forever out of place because I'm leaving you today
Flow Switch:
Ooh never change always be the same
Driving slow on purpose up in my fast lane
Then again I think you reason with the Kheaven
If perception is reality perceive that I be leaving
I know the reason
Uyou need something to believe in
God she's the type to kick a sleeping dog
Raw when I eat the beef like a freak I'mma  turning the other cheek
Bridge:
I don't wanna be the one to tell you it's over
I'm wise enough to see the sun I'm finally sober
I'm moving on you can't prove me wrong girl
There's nothing left to say cause I'm gone
Outro:
Nice to know ya
Can't believe it's almost over now when you just wanna let me go
Nice to know ya
And when I look up at your picture I see someone I ain't seen before

Boyz II Men, Can’t Fly Without Gravity,UnKnown," 
Now I’m sure most of you know the old story
About the astronaut who went far out into space
And was asked on his return
Whether he had been to heaven and seen God
And he said yes
And so they said to him, ""Well, what about God?""
And he said, ""Well, she’s black.""
And although this is a very well known and well-worn story, it is very profound
Because i tell you

Go ahead meddle in the melanin
Black man, black woman, black baby
Black man, white woman, black baby
White man, black woman, black baby
Nah I ain't racist but the numbers cry
Say cheese, pose for the photo, Sox doing
Promo in slowmo you seeing blacker than the rolo
(Muah) My wife half italian, lady in the street
But in the room she cut like a stallion
Nigga close your eyes and respect your women
It's all ice cream boy take your pick up in the ice cream store
Word to my nigga Meff and Chef for showing
For showing us the left right left
Hope burns in the undercurrent, even the jungle count
Concrete of foreigner all sweet and parent
Still black girl birth earth due to knowledge concrete
Of college and pass pass pass pass pass pass

Hey yo black is the new black
Born blue black black
The belly the sweeter coming out the curves coming out the back
Like daaamn
Michael jackson light skin but he too black and MTV knew that
A black ass on Kim Kardash

If you smoking dope or you trying to find Bob Marley
You drinking rum with the black coke
Racist against black coke
Come out son i don't want to get you dark
No matter where you from don't change Brown
You feeling me black and proud
Stand up for yourself cause you black and proud
If you too black white folks will block you out
Black people from the industry only niggers allowed
Bill Clinton was a black man
Love by the left persecuted by the right
Players in the club a drop skirt magnet
All full stop all these girls coming with some bagge
Full stop when the man steps up on the stage
And then smashed it yeah i hit the stage harder
When the real girls steps up
You put your body down the drop shot
I’m spitting in an old cup
I don't need y'all movement I’ll be
Here until your grand kids get gray hairs
Hit the spots like sun in the air
Going hard like i owe four months rent in arrear
See my Papa was a rolling stone i began cheif walk the block
Not I'm just rolling my own
Full steam down the hill everything up front
Getting smoked is like a fat ass blunt

I’m up against the monster
He’s cool it's his homies that will haunt you
Forever relevant king reign for president
Embassy in the stars
Currently earth resident
Before the year's end just lime like no ice with it
The ones who gives you the gun and advice with it
Before move bliss come and also concise with it
Or seeing you early like a fight with it
My lyrics stretched to hell fitted
So that's how i get gotta get it
And consolation a thousand dollars a minute
I make weather the storm what a good business

Taking out the suckers and you don't know how i did it
The stories bouncing up cat fictioning it
You going to take the picture as long as you in it
Never say die die always gonna be here
I can tell the difference because I’m always
Taking out the stucker and you don't know how i did it

Eyes keep shining soul stays divine

Now we swing swords in the dark and act ill

Full proof, but fools need proof
So I slide to the side and I act uncouth
But its just an act, cause I might react

Duh, don't get caught up on this planet man
These humans are crazy
Just don't even show them your microphone
Cause then you know what?
They wanna give you a record deal and then
You end up dead you know what I mean?
It's like body snatchers
But you know what?
We love hip hop
Stop, please stop please
Okay here we go

Holding my raps
Olden is golden and black
Extolling virtues of rap
With monkeys riding my back
I see them falling
Doing commercials and balling
I'm not a hater but she's closing the gate
And we stalling
Woke up in the early morning
I heard a voice that showed me the things to come
And told me I had a choice
To build it 300 cubits by 50 cubits
Driking thinking I'm stupid but deep in my heart I knew it
Money and fame could lead to emcee murder
You think you can escape but you can't take it any further
You call it writer's block
But you stop cause the vine is empty
Hip hop's not dead, it's really the mind of the emcee

It's all around me
It's emcee murder
Though God has found me
I thought I heard the
Sound of a thousand angels
It's the sound of danger
Know myself but I'm still a stranger
Emcee murder, emcee murder (oh)

I'll be damned if I do
And damned if I don't
My soul won't allow me to fake on the phone
Rocking the chrome
Another seed gets sown
Anonymous, I'm hailin from parts that's unknown
I looked to the heavens above to spread love
But emcees keep faking hoping to make the bacon
Matters mistaken, cause who we are is not physical
Bury mystical with the mind non typical
But, they want the cash flow
They steady scheming for the number one spot
These emcees they won't last though
I really feel somebody's watching me
From the third the star and telling us who we are
In this universe we like a speck of dust

Hallelujah,Joyful Rebellion,2004,"I walk down these city streets
Just a lonely man inspired
Hoping God will send me water down
To quench this burning fire
If I left here for the mountain
A monastery man
Things will stay the same so I'll remain
And show just who I am
Seeing things around me
Bonnie and Clyde
Graffiti with no message
Doctors, medicines deprived
But it doesn't really matter
They're blowin' in the wind
On the cover of a magazine

Hallelujah
Babylon is falling
Babylon is falling

I try to wash my dirty hands
But they won't come off the water
Hopin' truth will make me clean and then
Redeem my sons and daughters
Though they're not yet on that very highway
Pass along the load
That's why I left my memories far behind the lazy road
Seems so simple
Future's the past
The present all the things we holdin' on to make them last
But it doesn't really maeeaahhh (matter)
Loooord
Looky hear now

Hallelujah
Babylon is falling
Babylon is falling

Ahhhhh..

Highway 7,Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,2006,"(*Whispered*)
Peace!

...Hey, hey...
I was down to my very last song
Didn't even know which way to go
Couldn't believe that this was happening
I said, ""God please don't put me back
I didn't even see there was blood on the tracks
I was still compromising""

And then the rain came and the sun went down below
And the city arose from the water it was off the shore
And I realized what was happening; I had to pay the toll
It's true that you lose your mind when you gain control
But I was a fool to think I could play this game with you
Cause I was born to walk this higher road forever
There's no understanding all the things that people do
Cause when this higher road comes down we'll be born together
I said, when this higher road comes down we'll be born forever

Yeah...
I was down to my very last friend
I was on 
""Highway Kevin""
 again
Tell me why it's so hard to stay
In your place in the arms of the one
Seems I got too close to the sun
I was burning
Burning, burning, burning...

And then the rain came and the sun went down below
And the city arose from the water and the water flowed
And then I realized what was happening; you have to pay the toll
It's true that you gain your soul when you lose control
Fool to think I could play this game with you
Cause I was born to walk this higher road forever
See there's no understanding all the things that people do
But when this higher road comes down we'll be born together
I said, when this higher road comes down we'll be born forever

Hey, hey...
At night I toss and turn, cause it seems that I haven't learned
That the more that you fight and the more that you try
That's the way that you making the storm
If I had my way, I would bring you back to stay
But you're gone
All I got is the crown that you wore
Is the crown that you wore (Repeat 8x)
Higher road!! (Repeat 3x)

FlyPaper,Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,2006.0,"Feeling stuck?
Self-loathing?
Shoe gazing?
Pesky flies getting you down?
Try new supersonic FlyPaper
It's catchy, and it's pop

FlyPaper, do it again, do it again
Do it again, can he do it again?
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, can we do it?

Ya, you see it everyday
All the people standing at the train station
Left, right, left, right, left, right
We don't talk to each other now
We're an alien nation
Up, tight, up, tight, up, tight
I hope one day some things can get better
I hope some way our hearts can change the weather
As we walk this yellow road
And try to shake the load
In this 4-1-6 area code
It's another night in TV land
I say

I'm not one to repeat myself
But if it ain't broken
Don't fix it
I see you burning all that midnight oil
But I'm caught between a rock and a hard place
That's why I'm walking in the city with a hard face
Seems I'm afraid of being afraid

Do it again, do it again
Do it again, can we do it?

You think I don't know
Oh how I see your
Eyes run dry
Subliminal pro
I've got to go
Plus I couldn't be the
Pawn in your chess
Game for fame
But checkmate, I've got a new mind state
Plus I've got the power of the cat, rotate
I'm, straight digging in my record crate
Lights-only party so delete the hate
Time is a thief that leaves nothing behind
And I've got no grief for acts of crime in this fair city
I'm just a man who wants to understand
Who wants to know the plans, tell me the plans, tell me the plans


Do it again, do it again
Do it again, can we do it?

Yo, ok it seems at times that I'm under hypnosis
I suppose this city life is a process
I wrote this, like a million years ago
Tried to get out of the game a million tears ago
But I'm back, chillin', illin' for top billin'
Levitate to the ceiling by resurrecting the feeling
Hip-hop, it started out in the park
Are we lost in the dark? I think we maybe forgot?
But never mind that, we like to party
We don't start trouble and we don't bother nobody
'Cause Y is a letter with a long long tail
And I write these lyrics you can feel like brail
Hail, the most high, I post high
I used to swing low, now I let the crabs know that
My antimatter is shattering any ladder thats crawling with snakes

Nobody knows what you're doing!

God bless this planet, planet
Took life for granted, granted
This mic, mechanical, panic
God hold it single handed
Times like a left handed bandit
When right handed man
This bandit planned it
And propagandized it or Canada
It's so on ice and it's so raw
And yeah move yeah so power like thinking like a solider who
Would fall on his knees serve golden caps and such
To esoteric to touch
But, atmospheric enough to grab like a pink cat
Tag on a wall, b-boy at the park while DJ's rock the party
And mc's cook food for mr. pound it back
In the days when the rights outweighed the wrongs
Kid but, now the silly songs and electrical concerts
Don't leave a loop but I will just drop 16 bars on it
Life and death they roll in Siamese twins
So the day that hip-hop dies it's other life can begin
And we continue to

Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like that
Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like that
Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like

All around the world, we move it up
And yo we keep things striving
Soo high from heaven to the deep blue sea

Listen, 
I am not indie rock I was indeed hip-hop
With many styles I'm from the trine-ibal stop
No comma I'm my fathers persona
I'm ready spin my beat and maybe one day meet my momma
Sides I'm slinging verbs my intent is not sinister son of a minister
A bible thumping commissioner, finished an album
Scrap and draped the nostalgia of a cafeteria title
Battles just me and Nigel, now there spinning wax sticks, fixing the back seat crack
I can't entertain us, like kevin can't relax
Yell I'm spinning thoughts with anti gravital force
Shoot the monkey off my porch
And pass myself the torch to light it up

Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like that
Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like that
Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like that
Rock the microphone like this, rock the microphone like

All around the world, we move it up
And yo we keep things striving
So high from heaven to the deep blue sea
All I ever wanted to do
Was show you I had faith in you
But now I help you through the fire
You're so different, baby
You always got something to say
But it's more about the things you do

I see you walking every day
I even notice when your jeans are new
Looks like there's nothing left to say
How did I become such a selfish man?
Chasing my memories down the block
It's cause I'm hanging on the Avenue
That's why my girlfriend is hip-hop
So I don't, need you, to say
You don't love me if you don't
Cause I love, you anyway ohhh
I see you walking down the street sometime
I see you walking now and then
I see you on the tv-show sometime
Are you for real or just pretend?
And when the night shine falls
And the city lights shine
I'm right by your side
It's cause I'm hanging on the Avenue
That's why I got nothing to hide
Cause I don't need you to say
You don't love me if you don't
Cause I love you anyway ohhh

Rise Like The Sun,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(all original rude boys know what do I
So heed warning as I stand before you without sorrow
Driven eternally by the immortality of blackness
Which leaves me confused when gangstas die today
The sun will still rise tommorrow)
Aiyo, pain stains my brain, I go insane
At times I wonder if I even know my name
Or who I be, who I perceive to be me
In a world where the fake get payed fully
You can't fool me, if you can't cycle the greenbacks
I mean that, so just chill with your feedback
And all, all that talk about billboard charts
Number one hits with no heart
Now where as a kite gets you high like the rising sun
I be breakin' brothers down and suprising 'em
With my lyrical prophocies, no one's stopping me
Cause I magnify words to high velocity
Sing this, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
(Chorus)
I rise like the sun sometimes, but then I fall
And like a black moon I rise when the night falls
And when the night falls, the mic illuminates
And it's the ultra-violet rays that keep me rising on my mission
I take a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your desire
I got the vocab to set the world on fire
Now I remember laying back as a youth
Just looking at the sun, wondering about the truth
And how it's supposed to be
And how at times if the music felt close to me
Rocking spots since the age of sixteeen
You know what I mean, as I grab the microphone
Come correct and hit the scene
So let it fly baby, let if fly baby
I got the vocal canibus to get you high baby
You know these brothers rock the spot when it's all said and done
Definetly represent because we rise like the sun
(Chorus)
I'll save the vanity for your man and expanded to global spaces
You can see the cold heart looks on their faces
It's all a plan to exterminate the truest
Kos meditate like a microphone buddhist
Now, I'm not a teacher
Just trying to reach ya
I'll make you recognize
The sun will always rise
And even when the night falls, the moon illuminates brilliantly
It's all resellient, see
Sometimes I think about this world that we live in
And get fed up, and yo I think I want to give in
But it's the ultra-violet rays
Saving days
And stimulates my melonance
To eloquance

Greetings to you all (here we go, come on)
We came millions of miles to be here with you tonight (here we go, come on)
And we're gonna bring a man up to the microphone right now (here we go, come on)
And goes by the name of uh, well he doesn't know (check it out come on yo)

Shape shifing, uplifting, lyrical being here to terminate the bling bling
Six million ways to live, choose none
The devil's both left and right confusion
A new sun, a new earth has begun
Metabolical rates are changing, rearranging
This rhyme is entertaining and visually stimulating like an impressionist painting
Oooh, yo come follow me, what's the definition of a real MC?
Is it looking hard on MTV?
Or freestyling in a back street all-ey?
Muhammad, it's the return of the common
I'm bombing these rappers and dropping a hip hop megatron
From king street to eglington, we don't run
Cause when they got a mic, there's no need for a gun

And it don't stop, and it don't quit
It's all fortified so jump on it
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife
We rock from night, until morning
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
It's all fortified so jump on it
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife
We rock from night, until morning
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call

If you think about a thought, then you'll see that you're timeless
House the rhymeless, they're asleep like Linus
I find this, very stimulating to the mind
But drives me crazy at the same time
Am I this or that? human or black?
Extraterrestrial or right side of the tracks?
In fact, the shoes itself could be confusive
Here's a little story from the time that's elusive
I knew a girl by the name of Roxanne, met her in eighty-six
At the local band stand
New track suit, fat laces white sneakers
Moving to the sound comin' out of the speaker
Last week around queen and john, I saw her at the corner with a business suit on
I said ""what's up girl? you still check the vibe?
Remember de la soul? diamond d? and the tribe?""
She said ""no, no, I just don't listen
That stuff on the radio is not to transmission
Same beat, same lyrics, same song
I listen to my old school tapes to get it on""
I said ""word up girl? I know what you mean
It seems we're all trapped in the glitz and the gleam
The truth's just hidden for now, so don't sweat it
So here's a cassette"" and then I jetted!

And it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)
It's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)
We rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)
And it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)
It's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)
We rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)
And it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)
It's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)
We rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)
And it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)
It's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)
And to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)
We rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)

Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call
Get your back up off the wall
Can't afford to miss the boat when they call

High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

The Ballad of Noah,Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,2006,"I am conflicted
Traveling the path of the soul, so gifted
Still unable to break the mold, I lifted
The veil and still could not see
Insisted my existence began with me
Seems that I lost much, lost touch of reality
It cost much of the soul what a fallacy
This world is at times, I can't escape
See myself with new eyes, now I'm trying to take
The first step on a path that I know is paved with much difficulty
So I think I must save myself from a world that is falling down
All around me
I hear the sounds of laughter calling after me, falling too fast
My close friends are asking me
Casting their glance at each other as they speak with outstretched hands
Like I might be a victim of circumstance
But I run

If you reach a dead end trail
Pray to god it'll never fail
We've all walked in each other's shoes
But everybody sings the blues
Under the sky cross the land with a horse
It felt like the sky and the land were divorced
The way wasn't easy, a rock in the past
Said ""what's the matter with you"" and the rock just laughed
Carrying a load for the conscious untoiling
I went to the water and the water was boiling
The load was heavy and rocks filled my course
My horse drank the water and the water killed my horse
I tried to keep going, weak in the knee
A righteous wind blew and it was speaking to me
The way seemed harder since my horse been dead
I couldn't understand everything the wind said
Looked up at the sky and seen something strange
Returned to my country and my country was up in flames
The trees were bleeding; they said they couldn't hide me
Where will I run to without my horse beside me?

Just like King Midas turned things to gold
I touched my soul and felt my warm blood turn cold
I was told we paint the picture we want to see
The dream, she's the woman, I'm a machine
Jacqueline is my mother, but not Onassis
Wearing sunglasses taking me to pray on Sunday
Not one day, but three, we attended the church
Watched my father get up, grab the bible, and then work
The scripture, get the picture?
Preacher in my blood
And people in my hood, no threat of attack
Just a jean jacket and an Arcade quarter to numb the fact
From a peasy headed kid who was afraid to be black?
Imagine that type of ghetto, it still isn't settled
I play sex pistols and listened to heavy metal
I ate lunch all by myself in a meadow
And healed every scar with wishing to be a star
Now it's on, so tell me why I sing a sad song
Who's the pawn, was I being fooled all along?
Not at all cause now I'm strong
Innocence deterred, was never gone, I feel it coming, the break of dawn",https://genius.com/K-os-the-ballad-of-noah-lyrics

It goes stop, don't make a move, just freeze
Instead of tellin' a lie, get down on your knees
Please, give up the mic to MC's
Masters of the ceremony, is what we be

I was walkin' down the street about three o'clock
When I saw another MC at the end of the block
Talkin' to kids tellin' em, how they had to get the dough
So I rolled right up in the Cypher and said ""Yo!""
Here is an example of a whack MC
Caught in the world and he just can't see
He said, ""What? Aiyyo, you disrespectin' me?
Now I got to battle you and show them who the best be.""
He started spittin', he said, ""Somethin' somethin' hot.""
Then he tried to talk about the money that he got
I said, ""Shhh c'mon yo, that's all passé
I got to break it down another way like this now
Follow me here in this moment and time
Follow the rhyme created instigated to see the crime
You commit, when you sit in the past. Don't you know?
You construct a future based on everything that you know
But to get to the unknown, we surely must erase
All the preconceived notions they keep throwin' up in our face
On the daily. I run over tracks like Donavan Bailey
And break every record, in less than ten seconds.""
They said, ""Oooooh! That's a real metaphysical
We pull down the light cause 
the force is centrifugal""

Don't do the crime if you can't do the time

So ya change a little bit switch up your steeds
Now you got a bigger bag and countin' extra ki's
Please, everything you do we do with these
Real MC's are universal entities, that
Scope the universe lookin' for the fraudulence
Then we take a disguise like Clark Kent
My manner would have quick to check a scanner
For a weak MC sinkin' a city like Atlantis
You can't stand this, missile placed and you vanish
I meditate delevitate the twelve planets
You cannot withstand the heavy verbal attack
I'm the lyrical master blaster yeah I can do that
I can also be your style, because I analyzed it
You used to rock, but now you paralyzed it
Doesn't really matter like platinum blondes
Think what is an MC if he can't drop bombs
Don't really matter if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectin' is to wake up the dead
So pay attention it's the hard to behold
That everything that good it ain't gold, for real

The kind of diddy that invoke the spring
So control your desire to curse
While i crucify the verse

I crucify the verse 

Well it's the top dog underdog
Making MC’s stop dog
They bump their gums but they end up being locked jaw
This world is not yours since i was 7 years old
Your jelly beans will trap lords and wack toys
But I’m back ya’ll to smack up and fracture
The actors who lacked the real raw talent
And in fact ya’ll it's like that ya’ll
I have the mike and you never get it back no
And even though it's still gimy
The lights are brilliant and blinding
They try to play us like buck wee and tiny
But they can't crucify me cause my style
Is like a mystery history shows
Magician reposes the crap that those
Who makes doe pressing status that is old
Oodles of old oodles of old
Noodles and tou food
It’s so true my tongue kung fu will punk you
And tump you you punk crew you done dude


Yow this is a stick up stick up
When i Pick up Pick up
Microphone dem rappers lick up lick up
Like a plate of hot bricks
A stock tip these entertainer with pop hit
On rocket will fall back to earth like the natholum
I’m chin checking them seconds am docking them
Scolding rexing and faxing them vaxing them
Straight disrespecting hackling  jeckling lex lutering them
Disassembling the gremblings
I'm feeling another part of reality
Every where i represent the transity
The double edge bager rapper
Singer slang Peter I’m so deranged in it
So yes i bring the danger
I’m not a pagan not poking vegetarian
Who brings the beacon home
And eats them see’s like Cole Steigen
Make no mistaking I’m not Ronald Reagan

The world is a ghetto
Freedom, oh yeah
Feel your sorrow
5:35 and I'm living senseless
Just another homie picking on the defenseless
Don't request yet, nothing really to mention
Looking through the mirror and I'm making a censure
Whoa, black people in the mall grease
Came around the corner and she caused me to freeze up
Ease up, watch how the world could tease us, ease us
But only G.O.D can please us
Hey, got my ride and my Momma's too
Show me how to roll without breaking the rules
Paying my dues, MC's dropping out choose
Decides to get with lyrical facts, don't stop
Whoa, black people dying to shop
Everything is fine when you're losing your mind
I'm like a black alley cat, freestyle battle rap
Doesn't get better than that, is that a gat in the back?

And the Valkyrie's blood runs red through the halls of the dead
And the warrior's blood runs red through the hearts of the dead
And the Valkyrie's blood runs red through the halls of the dead
And the life you're been looking for in the world that you live
And the life you're been looking for in the world that you live
In the name, we were all born in the flame
Not the same, but under the moon on the desert plane
We roam, home, take the ?coast ghost?
I saw with my naked eye, way to close now
I was the son of a man on a mission
Who worked with his hands and brought him to foreign lands
In the hinter-land, swinging the mic like an axe
With a fear in the atmosphere, laying down tracks",https://genius.com/K-os-valhalla-lyrics

Swing high then swing low

I was rushing to the end
But you're everything I saw, again
And hoping to pretend
I was knocking on heavens door my friends

Everything is cool, believing in my name instead of his
And then the sun came out
I couldn't find the shade, I'm not afraid
Of the light anymore

Heavens on the side be patient
The universe is wise

Black Ice - Hymn For Disco,Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,2006,"Sometimes the way we look at life can be too serious
Cause we dancing by the pale light
I wake up in the morning and I feel delirious
Cause of something that I did last night
But then an angel came onto me
She said that, ""Life is more than you see
You've got to be the change that you be
So don't die, just try...""

We just some fools with the lights turned on
Hoping your coming too, and turning up the moon
I'll play it cool till the night's over
When are you coming back
To save this heart of mine, yeah

Time to take it slow
Black ice, white snow
What is the truth, is we don't really know (Uh-huh)
If so, then life is a mystery
This could be the end of all history
But wait! The sun rises to the east
And the world still spins 360 degrees
On it's axis this intergalactic practice
Of rhyming proves that there's no beginning or ending
Or timing and it's been a long haul
Rise like the sun and get your back once more
People party in the light game show
Once again, we dumb it down to ease off the flow
What's the the definition of this thing called ""Black""? (Huh?)
I had a premonition 18, way back (Yup)
That black's the color of the universe of whence we came
I wonder if my souls on ice again

Hoping your coming too, and turning up the moon

Check it out! Okay
I've got something for you
It goes like this, check it out
Wake up in the morning, press the cold gate
Brush my teeth then I'm hitting the streets to meditate
Went outside, and the sky was rather grey
But I paid no attention kept moving upon my way (Uh-huh)
Went down the block and skipped a little further
Until I saw a kid and he said, ""What's up with emcee mur...""
That was then, son (son), this is now
I live in the moment like a why to a how
Wow, that's profound, just break that down
That's when I proceeded to show him the pro to the noun

Microphones fully loaded and friends
Funny I try to make this end
But it seems I'm returnin' the name
Yeah, papercutz
Papercutz, Paper
Here we go, papercutz
Papercutz, paper
Paper, cutz, papercutz, paper, paper
Are you gonna do another album man?

Yo, I know I said I'd exit
But I couldn't do it the minute
It flowed from my lips
Futures can't exist
In a past time paradise
Rollin' dice, 
holdin' Christ
On a platinum chain, surrounded by Isis
And Osiris, you can't deny this
Because the lightheads
Brokin' and tokin's been replaced by legal tender
Great pretenda, tried to upset my agenda
I dismembered, their thought patterns
And Now they move in circles like Saturn
Spinning out of orbital formation
The radio station is hating so my motivation
Is the pen and the pad, only friends that I had
When the light can not be seen
I'm a feel for the rap game and skatin' like I'm a figurine
That move in articulate shadow boxing appeal
What is real is irrelative, just relatively revealed
That's why I sharpen these words
To you like papercutz
And direct visual images like I'm Julian Lutz
What's the name of this runaway train?
We call it thought, harassin' the brain
Driving humans insane
This thing called the rap game, I'm claimin' insane
Lyrically all arcane, and such as papercutz

Catacalysmic, mistic, with a bic
Only to think on a diamond mine
Gotta take it back, from the heart attack
That I felt when I saw the sign
Comin' down from the sky
Like a supernova, Jehovah
Got a crib and a Land Rover
But so what, I'm not sober
Just takin' sips but I don't skip
Just makin' trips so I don't tip
These papercutz just ain't enough
They makin' hits, and I can't touch
Just look at Hammer now
My grammar is tighter, provider
In light of freedom fighter, rhythm writer and rappin'
And yet you don't try it
Because you can't buy it
I saw you grippin' and slippin'
And fool, I'm so tired
Of fake emcees and you best believe
Got tricks of the trade runnin' up my sleeve
And I pray to God when I'm on my knees
That I can break it, cut this paper, Paper",https://genius.com/K-os-papercutz-lyrics

Spit the plates, the great debates over
Dont rush, take it easy, slow down

Were in it, together, we can make it better
Don't sweat a, thing swing with no vendetta
I rhyme in a graph style, carve every letter
To move every B-boy 
king like Coretta
Scott
, keep it hot block once rock
The plot that we tried to recignise was not
The L to the O-V, M-O-V-E
K dub dropin' the dub, thats new TV
The E-M-C double E no doubt
Runin' the route, wakin' out, turnin' the party out
We all fall from grace and make mistakes
And race the pace the base with the anidote ""base""
And every single word in the verb wildstyle
Its not a mission its a riddle lifestyle
I'm still in the struggle and I see the light dial
Turnin' to ten, ascend, with zen, the profile

Can you feel it, to the beat ya'll
Let the music play for the people
And if you're down to rock, whether your ready or not
Yo, guess whos back with the sequel
Oh ya, just do it
Oh ya, just do it

Now, in the beginning the light shined so bright
Within the city of my mind-scaped night
Listening, glistening the moon reflecting the sun
Makin' me one with the music
Oh, get low, get for, get ho
Its liquid black gold
Yes I'm in the house but I never ever sold
Rhyme like vinyl, 20 years old
With the mic in my hand, ringin' alarm
Singin' the song, bringing the calm to dramas so hard
To much info, been so instrumental, potential, exponential
My DJ's cuts are presidential
Yo Jazz, let the rythym hit 'em
I woke up to make the main cut, to face the pain
What does space contain love?
Its the heat-seaker, packin' the speaker to beat the sleek creature
It was written
The sequel

Can you feel it, to the beat ya'll

Right here this is heat, yo, yo
Massive massive

There's something deep inside
That's telling you that love's so much more
This is just a masquerade
When everything's alright
You know it's time for the writing wars
If it's just a masquerade

When I feel the way of my lost innocence
Looking for emotions that all fall aside
Everything is waiting on that dominance
Hoping for new opuses and alibis
And I'm with you, oh ohohohoh
If I could starve from falling
And I bet you, oh oh  oh silenced the
Voices in your head but there's no place to go

There's something deep inside
That's telling you that love's so much more
This is just a masquerade

Yo, yo
I sit back with the microphone
Watchin' these MC's turn to actors
Producin' all the factors
That flip life, into a masquerade
We like a bunch of mannequins
Battery operated, inoculated
With five sentences connect us to the Earth
Rich sinners since the days of my birth
For what it's worth, dissuaded love
I'm steadily spreadin' love over the beat down
Let's meditate and feel the heat now
Like beautiful rain, on the desert plain
'Cause the sun parch the ground on the weak sound
I break it down, to elements H2O
A place to go, that you can't escape the flow
Does not exist, I love the truth so I persist
Intelligent men? Or just ""Gorillas in the Mist""
Clenchin' a black fist, for the size of dollar bill
I leave the space so you can think about it now so just chill

(There's something, there's something deep in)
(There's something)
There's something deep inside
That's telling you that love's so much more
This is just a masquerade
When everything's alright
You know it's time for the writing wars
If it's just a masquerade
Black shit, ration, tryin' to step up
But they can't even cash it
Kick that shit

(First saved message)
In this venture, nothing gained
I've only just touched the surface
Once nervous, when writing for a worthless purpose
It was once more than this, before the heart left the beat
The soul left the speech, I'm still trying to reach
My niche, and teach the love again
Inside the hate of a present day
Got stepped after, being genuine we're swept away
Before the importance of diamonds, bells
And a platinum place, fallen from grace
Not my campus with another trace
Of the same thing I came in, this thing is worth saving
Standing in the pockets holding tongues of what I'm saying
Blaming myself only for supporting what they're playing
I may peek through the storm, but now it's raining
Unchanging of late, it's hard to be creative
Although creating is native to me, I tried to be
Even patience couldn't save it, from the days of pages
They couldn't believe I would say this
No longer without wings, Kamau is what my name is
Too many undermind, what I underline
Placing my poetry underneath their making of rhymes
It was a creation of frustration
Brown bricks or blank slates
Subway trains and cardboard bound with masking tape
It was the sound of the evening, the way the day grew late
Words tumble from lungs over my tongue
And gave a new taste to my fate
It doesn't even matter how the chatter would paint us
With love on our side they could barely stand against us
Um, what up? Uh Kheaven, what's goin' down?
Um I got your message, and uh yeah, basically call me back
Basically call me back and tell me
Sorry about the length of the message, but you know
You feelin' it? Aight man peace

Can't be violated or even be imitated

Introduction, microphone holy roller
Remember my mother used to push me up in a stroller
She used to watch Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda
While my pops took apart machines by motorola
I'm bipolar
In grade ten I took granola
Brought it to school and played rugby with Jimmy Stola
I got older and the planet was getting colder
Felt Like Luke Skywalker lost without Yoda, Soul controller
Only black kid in my grade, Rock the fade
No doubt those people didn't know the
Pecking order
So I read books on yoga
Prayed to my heavenly father for him to show the
Way to the yellow brick road the episode
Has got me caught at the dock of the bay
Just like Noah
Now I'm over the fatal suburban coma
Big up Fatsky, Marvel, my man Mocha

Lord help me find a way to deal with the pressure
Cause these people just don't know
At times I want to go

Strumming on the guitar and telling me no lies
Behind the dark skin, was a soul of Isis
Priceless,

And she was the water

With southern twang claiming to be from Georgia
But I couldn't believe she had to be from galaxies
Far beyond and Kevin was so fond
Of the shape of her hands
I studied the lines in her face
Wondering if in her womb was the secret of human races
Face it

Lookin' at my watch it's about that time to ascend with this art of Zen

Leading to a revolution
Solution is seeing the mind as it rotates
Make no debate, when I regulate, all the gens will terminate
Cause we cut and slice irrelevance to the bone
And decapitate rappers that idolize Al Capone or Jimmy Hoffa
Not a hip-hop poppa, just a vigilante with the mic that I shot ya
Chopped up, beat 'em and we proceeded to rock the bells
Movin' quite well, so we got 'em hopped up

I don't eat fish, chicken or hamburger
But I eat 40 emcees on a hot plate

Magnificent and munificent
This is militant, in particular significant
To the people, masses,lower classes
Making the hardest of hard keloidal and flaccid
Contaminants with backstage laminate sheet unoriginal thoughts

Which we perceive to alter the mind-state
Making time wait, holding us up for hostage

Find something fresh to wear
Hoping I open up the door now
Seems that the cupboard is bare

We keep it down, Figure Four kinda love
I pull out the mic, and shock MC's for spite
Whatever I write, magnifies heavenly sight
You said you shinin', but that really means you reflect
I absorb light within my pores and then connect
With the righteous one, he told me son, ""Forget it
Live your life for the truth don't anyone ever let it.""
They dead walkin', trapped on the Earth light walkin'
I meditate day to day so I can stay on the right path
How many knew just what I'm feelin'?

To the non-believers, deceivers that can't see this
They blind to the fact but I can't relax
I keep runnin' see the light towards the sun and
They keep shunnin', but I bow my head to The One and then

The spirit is under attack, and I lead the war
With my battalion, lyrical stallion, riding
Dividing the sheep from the golden lyrical quote
If not you could get smoked, by the mind is sore genius
I mean this I guarantee you never seen this before
Rappin' over guitars and finger snaps
My rapid raps, open a whole fire bun
He told me son, so check it out

He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you
He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you

(Red 1)
Yo, my war's against the foundation
Of a global united nation
When humans rule the world
By the codes of free mason
Hallucinated, by the quest for domination
An equation, which equals the battle station
Ready to bust, capture and crush
Move a nine of us, stealth style rebellious
Prefer profile, cause the beast is hideous
So move agile, seek the facts and compile
More wisdom, smokin' isms
That your knowledge and your children
Give thanks and it has nothin' to do
With the fuckin' Pilgrims
Startin' the curriculum, the Devil wants to be Ichiban
Interception is how this is done
But by the locks of the dreaded don aka Red 1
We'll emerge the champion cause the war is on
So grab your Teflon, your muskets and your swords
And peace love and unity will be your reward

He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you
He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you
He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you
He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you
He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you
He told me, Son, follow me
And I will come to you

We know those Satans and those devils, they have been there for a long time, and I am sick and tired of their bullshit. What they are trying to do is create conflict. Saying what they are trying to put between us as superstars",https://genius.com/K-os-follow-me-lyrics
Chocolate Chewing Gum,Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,2006,"*appears at the end of ""The Ballad of Noah"" as a bonus track*
Wake up in the morning, press the Colgate
Brush my teeth
, then I'm hitting the streets to meditate
Went outside, and the sky was rather grey
But I paid no attention kept moving upon my way
Went down the block, and skanked a little further
When this kid came up, he said what's up with MC Murdah?
That was then son, this is now
I live in the moment like a why to a how
Wow, that's profound, just break that down
That's when I proceeded to show him the pro to the noun
I found instead of trying to be what I was
I be what I is which makes us the wizard of us
Plus I'm really sick and tired of complaints
Of hip hop this, rap that and what it ain't
I'd rather do a dance, find some romance
Or pray to my father in heaven to get a chance
He glanced down and looked rather disappointed
But then he looked up and looked up and looked ra-rather anointed
He said, ""MC Murdah, they wait for the man
And the master of the ceremony that was unplanned""
Damn, you quit pit you know
Plus I grab microphones from here to Gadow
I keep my mind still like the art of tablow
And no matter what they say I go on with the show
We laughed, and gave each other a pound
Exchanged numbers, I said kid see you around
Continued with my stroll for that lazy afternoon
But then out from the sky I heard a great big boom
Eh, yo, I couldn't tell you why
But purple rain straight started falling from the sky
I started to cry, I thought it a lie
I prayed for my mother oh me oh my
You should of seen the people jumping and crying and screaming
Believing the seasons was changing; the rain was the pain of the nature
And running and coming and going and low and beholding
And wishing the sun was golden and hoping it wasn't over
Damn, now people to this day can't tell you what I saw
It was raw; it broke every mortal thought, every law
Yo, in awe I was, a buzz, then a light, and it said to me right
""We be them rap kids from galaxies a far
And it seems that maybe your rhymes are up to par
So if you want to live on within this universe
You have to kick a dope verse, and don't curse""
Oh hey well what do you know?
My life came down to how well I could really flow
So I thanked god for this magna stage
And dropped that rhyme on the corner and it went this way:
I take it to the limit infinite, I been it committed to finish
I did it and if they bit it I heavy hitted to get it
This record of water is sort of the slaughter of mortal thoughts
It borders on orders and can't be thought of the ""bought by cash""
K dash, fly from going to last, what is the task you ask
And what alien form is this man talking
Is he human or Vulcan, escaping or stalking
Or walking away from the rhyme by sledding down white hills of snow
Tobogganing canadiana, my granny Georgiana, my brother stays in Atlanta
I rock over cabanas of intellectual manners
You get hit by the gamma rays sort of like David Banner
Now the mind is a terrible thing to waste
Even worse is the great void of infinite space
That extends beyond time
Beyond all math
Your watch can only measure the second that just passed but
That doesn't matter; I'm just a B-Boy
That gets mad excited when the crowd makes

Dance In Yo Car, Can’t Fly Without Gravity,UnKnown,"Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Word up!

I make a call but you're not there
I fly a ship into outer space, there
Up to me, but there's nothing to say
I forgot how to pray now
And if the sun falls out the sky
And all the truth you know, turn lies
Up to you, but there's nothing to say (to say)
You forgot how to pray now

Check it out
You've read every book on your shelf
You know every single word by heart
But it does no good
Cause the world's so cold
The world's so cold
And when the morning comes
It's just so hard to get out of bed
Because this world don't know how deep you go
But something's calling you


Oh we back slide
Hard to believe how we left this ride
Used to believe in the man in the sky
Now we believe in the plan in our eye
Besides, if we tried to pray
Who would be listening anyway
Tried to get down
To the sounds of my youth
No  so now I'm out

You can't dance at all
They can take you far
Make you into a star
Get in your car

It's the end of the jiggy era
People on the planet Earth are tired
In an effort to aid a great shipment millions of bodies incarnate (GET UP!)

Complex, this hip hop alchemy
When I was a kid I watched Electric Company
Now I'm all grown living life to the bone
New tone, spaceship take me home
Back to the seventh sun the seventh one
When I drop patience, Kevin's Dun
This eloquent macula is black enough
To bring a shake to Dracula
Uh, I'm hitting them with synonym adrenaline
Then I send them to the kingdom of the heavens
A matter of time before this rhyme
Infiltrates the bloodstream into the mind

So lonely she went to California

Telling me that you are, when you know that you're not

Thinking, ""Why the hell do I front, I'm hardcore""
Like Castro, master flows pass the golden links
Whatever you think its all old, you get it?
Whatever the cost I will not floss
Emcees act the boss they all get tossed
Off the plank
Hold the dank I don't burn
I got a lot to say but really lots to learn
Turn, baby you're just not concerned
Whatever earned, thinking of the most high earned

This is the mission out a small time thing
Let me tell you bout what happened when the phone went
I was chillin' at the crib with this girl named Wise
She was kissin' my brain, caressin' my third eye
When the phone rang, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
But just when things started goin' great
It rang again, I said hold up, wait
Picked up the phone, ""Yeah who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
Hip hop is dyin' it's all Darth Vader
So pick up your mic and swing your light sabre.""
The Skywalker, the fly talker from the 
T-dot
We got, beats and lyrics to get you up
Kick in the door, wavin' my ASR
Who got my back? In fact it's Figure Four
I keep it raw, cross the city just like Bloor
Rappers are claimin' to be hardcore
But never no more

Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique

There's only two digits; zero and number one
But some get fooled by countin' bullets in a gun
I make a run, with that renegade Red 1
We so close you can figure us cousins
So step up if you want to get taxed
Hip hop used to be black, but now it laxed
The brick cause they mostly spit like demonology
My psychology not dependant on pimpology
Cause pimps just react to things, men make 'em happen
This rappin' dedicated to soul clappin'
If you got soul, then The Infinite's in control
Stop using mine, people to legitimize
Yourself cause you raped the Earth and tell lies
My man positive intelligent and wise
I don't suck energy son, I energize
This is dedicated to make it live, bring it back

Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it

I won't fear anymore-more
Hip-hop is back for sure, sure
'Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for MC-C's
Who sold out so easily-ly
But the truth shall set them free, free
Have no fear, no, no fear, oh no

It's a return of an original man
From outer space
The human race
Is like eyes without a face
I pulled your card
I saw you try to fool God
And now you wanna switch up the game, it's rather hard
Damn, I thought that they was down for mine
But alas, a good woman is hard to find
So I get up, I'm really fed up with infidelity
This is my penalty for infiltrating with the melody
At times I look at my face in the mirror
And wonder if the picture is clearer
To me than to them
But then again
They sell crack to kids
And that's what is
So I just attack the biz
And it's just my soul obligation
To unite this whole hip-hop nation
Face it, we takin' over your radio station
Hasid, this is the time for jubilation

I won't fear anymore-more
Hip-hop is back for sure, sure
'Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for MC-C's
Who sold out so easily-ly
But the truth shall set them free, free
Have no fear, no, no fear, oh no

Now, we can break it down like this
And we can break it down like that
They stole hip-hop
Come on, let's take it back
To east coast stomping
Romping over the rhythm
And then I hit 'em
With the most beautful jewels
That shine through the darkness, sparkness
Some are concerned with
Who's the hardest artist
Call me the fluent MC
Slipping through the cracks
Bring it back definitely
Now, who is the man that's forgoten his name
Living in shame
And can't recall the place where we came from
The same one dancing on your video screen
Hideous dreams
I can't belive we do it for cream, yo
But it's the anthem to turn back the tables
Fables, whack MC's working for labels
I'll see you all in the next lifetime
It's not Kheaven
Just a message from Serious Seven

I won't fear anymore-more
Hip-hop is back for sure, sure
'Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for MC-C's
Who sold out so easily-ly
But the truth shall set them free, free
Have no fear, no, no fear, oh no

Don't ask me why

Don't ask me why
When they're coming from the sky
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

When they're coming from the sky
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

You wanna rap with me
I'm a rap Vader
You wanna rap against me

I don't really care that I'm burning some bridges

It's just the same ol' story
It's such a different story
It's just the same ol' story
It's for the game..
When I was a young boy
I always seemed to care what they thought about me
But now I'm all grown up and I make my own choice
I will be standing tall, dropping down on my feet
I don't really care that I'm burning some bridges
We don't need no water, let it burn to the ground
Some might fear, some of them are superstitious
But my ear is to the ground cuz I walk the streets downtown
Downtown, downtown
Downtown…
Where ever the crown, it's downtown
Turn on the light
Cuz your left hand knows what you're doing with your right
And when the right hand glows, left is jealous of the light
So you put them both together and you clap for your life
Time, that's why I'm back in the building
Convert the flame the faith that I was building
Get off the bridge all the women and children
Fire code, sheep in wolf's clothes
I don't really care that I'm burning some bridges
We don't need no water, let it burn to the ground
Some might fear, some of them are superstitious
But my ear is to the ground cuz I walk the streets downtown
Downtown, downtown

Who would think that you would be the one to break my heart

You should try
Again
Yea

Road rage, I'm hungry everyday
I rap to lay tracks, rappers rap to get laid
They want to get paid, I don't blame them
But still I flame up with this microphone
I'm the mad rapper, I hate'em
Hate's a strong word, but so is loving rap
So let your gun clap if you're an emcee like that
I'm not a thug, I just represent everything that's overdubbed
Where my people at, show me love
And in the club I try to roll with the best of them
Popping bottles is  mentality that's like a decimal point
I'm not a hater, but I hail from south of the equator
Where the sunlight is greater, It's still a vager
I'm not a player, I'm just a black record that wants to get played
So DJ cross the fader
Sooner or later we're all gonna meet our maker
So throw your hands in the sky, I'm the crusader like


Don't even ask how the high feel
Ask how do I feel, probly how the sky feel
These jokers come in sideways like in Seinfeld
All the grapes of wrath intertwined like a vine still
Physically I'm ill walking through a mine field
With a straw sticking out a Molotov cocktail
21 grams of soul on a rock scale
Probably burn like flaming coals on a hot grill
Well if the afterlife is absolutely not real
Then when you finish you just gone, it's a done deal
Beyond that my heart beat is like a drum fill
As if I'm living on the run with a gun still
Bring the hero back, he'd a taken care of that

Slang my slang is ostenacious
Slipping them scripts them Ellen Pages

Like Batman, I punched him out

Thinking deep girl

Wish those kids watch Hanna-Barbera
I wish I had another me like 
Tegan and Sara
I wish I had a girlfriend that looked like

Compared to Lauren all them girls were boring
Then I went away and when away on tour, and
When I came back Lauren had a new boyfriend
I said ""Yo, L will you marry me, will you take me to the alter and rescue me”
She said ""I'm not down with the groupie scene and all these girls on computer screens”

Pumping it chill, girl

I came from galaxies to represent this hip hop nation
I'm kickin' the same ol’ game with no name
Fame in the astral plane is ordained
Flame on!

I still have FUN, my trio Run, Dee, and Fable

My life is like a dream but inside i wanna scream cuz when i wear my sneakers n jeans i feel seventeen

To do a thousand smiles

Look at the crowd they're jinglin
Everyones mingling
Hip-hop bringing people together
Tougher than leather, like Run-d.m.c

Or stay down, like a nomad wearing a crown
I ricochet my vocabulary to slay

Fake rock stars hiding behind guitars

Switch off the auto-tune toes toward this red thing

See now you're lost in the plot
We're not, we're just true black diamond hearts
You put us on the cover to cover back to back
Sun doesn't shine
Its still a funk pop marshall ahh
I'm not from the ghetto
But my mama is and she's an uptown girl
I know it's hard to let it go
But you gotta stay up when you're down
Another world, another town
Another letdown
It's all the same
Oh it's insane
And there's no one to blame
Connect the dots omit the Gobots
Hotels, new towns takin' up whole blocks
Taxi, take me to the jam of the year
Get there everybody stop and stare
At the disco ball won't miss my call to rock
Fistful of dots and a new boom box
Bangin, slangin, a capellas to sellas
Don't be jealous, what if all we say is embellished?
Yo it's an uptown world
Electric slide to the side of your mind
Hey to her to me it's all the same
No man's land is how I'm playin the game

Rise Like the Sun (Part I: The Dawn),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(all original rude boys know what do I
So heed warning as I stand before you without sorrow
Driven eternally by the immortality of blackness
Which leaves me confused when gangstas die today
The sun will still rise tommorrow)
Aiyo, pain stains my brain, I go insane
At times I wonder if I even know my name
Or who I be, who I perceive to be me
In a world where the fake get payed fully
You can't fool me, if you can't cycle the greenbacks
I mean that, so just chill with your feedback
And all, all that talk about billboard charts
Number one hits with no heart
Now where as a kite gets you high like the rising sun
I be breakin' brothers down and suprising 'em
With my lyrical prophocies, no one's stopping me
Cause I magnify words to high velocity
Sing this, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?

I rise like the sun sometimes, but then I fall
And like a black moon I rise when the night falls
And when the night falls, the mic illuminates
And it's the ultra-violet rays that keep me rising on my mission
I take a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your desire
I got the vocab to set the world on fire
Now I remember laying back as a youth
Just looking at the sun, wondering about the truth
And how it's supposed to be
And how at times if the music felt close to me
Rocking spots since the age of sixteeen
You know what I mean, as I grab the microphone
Come correct and hit the scene
So let it fly baby, let if fly baby
I got the vocal canibus to get you high baby
You know these brothers rock the spot when it's all said and done
Definetly represent because we rise like the sun

I'll save the vanity for your man and expanded to global spaces
You can see the cold heart looks on their faces
It's all a plan to exterminate the truest
Kos meditate like a microphone buddhist
Now, I'm not a teacher
Just trying to reach ya
I'll make you recognize
The sun will always rise
And even when the night falls, the moon illuminates brilliantly
It's all resellient, see
Sometimes I think about this world that we live in
And get fed up, and yo I think I want to give in
But it's the ultra-violet rays
Saving days
And stimulates my melonance

Do let her know you love her bad

We love you very much
And It’s the beginning of a hard day
When in I’m spending about to roll out
Holding hands with the  threat i progress
I stage on this microphone
Gold silver diamond studder i walk along
To the lobby of disease i came and see no tables
Life was simple when i dropped these hits on record labels
Now I’m a blackjack bagel with my ace in the stack
Throw your hands real high trying just to get by by by by


You see them chrome microphones females in arms
Else if it feel good do it like salome
Self help psychology my genealogy
Is king to El Hamid ringing and drumming
Fenamilaming i really like the new place I’m in
Move your body i make some mr mike magic money
Ain't nothing funny when i blast through the roofs
Like gas to the cats to the goose to the rusty rats
None lives here at last last last last


Yea call me the pine piper typewriter
The high lyric inside of serving the right writer
The night tiger the kid that makes you flip your lighter
The sole provider the high priest must think Mosiah
I’m on holy fire
I’m not a criminal not a killer I’m a thriller
Just let me know the J dealer

Equalizer,Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,2006.0,"""Hit it""

This is a broadcast from the universe
Supersonic bond, metaphor, megahertz
I'm on a mission with the mic in the holster
Spread the love from coast to coast hear the dope for editing
My only enemy's inside of me
Trying a lot of me but my degree's in the anatomy
My thoughts, they rotate, like planets round the sun
I observe them one by one, like a scientist
Once again kids be breaking the rules
Taking the school, the MCs playing the fool
What do you do, when all eyes are looking at you
For the answers to impossible questions that ain't true
That when I fall back
Recognize magnetic attraction pulling light down to this physical fraction
Makes me human, that why I humanize
I came to make the breaker, make it equalize

There's no need to run
Staring at the sun
There's one place left to go
And everybody knows
Things are going to change
There's only better days coming

I'm back from sabbatical this mathematical magical stealth with the microphone
Seeking knowledge of self
Its here to elevate, regulate, or discombobulate
The weight of illegitimate fate now
Whatever the time, remember the mind's not the body
It's probably my last time but maybe not cause I've
Got a new style, it's what's up
Pain of the people means pop don't stop
Ladies and gents this is school house rock
Changing the plot, hip-hop with me or not
Ripping apart, its stereotypical art
Holding me back cause rap's not a grade of the dark
Jimi Hendrix was a hero to most
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host
All the unknowns, they were heroes to most
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host, equalize

Gimmie a beat
Gimmie a beat

I'm walking down this open road
I've got to shake this heave load
I know there's things in life I'll never see cause heaven only knows
Take this heavy load
Down this open road",https://genius.com/K-os-equalizer-lyrics

Pick up these guitars, not negative heat knocks, now

Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
Pressure bring, pressure flowin' on my head like rain
But fame can bring pain
That's why I got game and a rude attitude
That I call Emily *hay*
So you can get the Prozak if you claim to know that
What I'm livin', I break it down like long division
A mathematician, with inner vision like Stevie
No Wonder, I make a move-a from one street to

Lookin' for philosopher stone

She was kissin' my brain, caressin' my third eye
When the phone rang, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to forget it, ignore it, leave it
But just when things started goin' great
It rang again, I said hold up, wait
Picked up the phone, ""Yeah who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business

So pick up your mic and swing your light sabre.""

Kick in the door, wavin' my ASR

I keep it raw, cross the city just like gore
Rappers are claimin' to be hardcore
But never no more

Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique
Some just lost, they floss they don't get it
When I fall off things I'm quick to admit it
If you love this life I know you'll get with it
Cause all in all it's fantastique

There's only two digits; zero and number one
But some get fooled by countin' bullets in a gun
I make a run, with that renegade Red 1
We so close you can figure us cousins
So step up if you want to get taxed
Hip hop used to be black, but now it lacks
The brick cause they mostly spit like demonology
My psychology not dependant on pimpology
Cause pimps just react to things, men make em happen
This rappin' dedicated to soul clappin'
If you got soul, than The Infinite's in control
Stop using mine, people to legitimize
Youself cause you raped the Earth and tell lies
My man positive intelligent and wise
I don't suck energy son, I energize
This is dedicated to make it live, bring it back

Some just lost, they floss they don't get it

If you love this life I know you'll get with it

And did you know, when the verog on my style is vado
Kick 'em, pew the rag, took her back to the coupe

Watch it boat, lemme make it back, my head so futuristic black

Looking for answers from a Femme fatale hardcore
What am I looking for?
I just don't know
I orchestrate flows but not for dough
And really though
I got a triple seven area code
From the side of the road
About way past suppertime
Bust a rhyme on her
To alleviate the drama
But the more that I explore her
It's double I feel ignore her
Ant on the hill, a worker bee to the queen
Of vocabulary arts burning hearts of human beings
True human becoming I'm running
But cunning the number one stunner
Persona is chaseable
Making one replaceable
And damn every time I think I want to face her
With some tickets to the ball standing in the elevator
On my way to her palace I get up to the seventh floor
Then jet to the fire exit door with faith no more
 Mr. Telephone Man won't you help me with my line
When I call the triple seven I get machine every time
And I wonder if it's possible you're playing with my mind
And I really want to know you won't you please give me a sign
And whoa it's a long way down
Said whoa it's a long way down from the fall from grace
We went from pagers, beepers, phones, to creepers
Ringtones, text messages, not reaching
Speaking close all up in my receiver
Afraid to meet in person the dial tone deceiver
Pick up, hang up, break up, banger
Man I wanna press every button Atlanta
Area code South Beach number I forgot it
We cross bionic style exotic forget about it
Now here's what I'm thinking
Is this ship sinking?
While we're dancing and drinking
Could we be at the brink and?
Mr. Telephone Man I call you every night
You never answer my call I'm starting to get uptight
I guess I'll keep rhyming designing and flipping the script
And dancing on my own time
In my own mind but wait
It seems this Mr. Telephone Man
Is a woman with a man in the palm of her hand damn

Mr. Telephone Man won't you help me with my line
When I call the triple seven I get machine every time
And I wonder if it's possible you're playing with my mind
And I really want to know you won't you please give me a sign
And whoa it's a long way down
Said whoa it's a long way down from the fall from grace
I said I really want to have a talk
Get your hands off my mic don't grab it off
I said I really want to have a talk
Get your hands off my mic don't grab it off

I’m on your mind like a skully or a snap back
And I’m eatin MC’s like a handful of cracker jacks
Yea can't have the four foogie
I once had a fetish fetish for some bootie
A girl up in West Hollywood she never use to do me
Polished my furniture as if she never knew me
Like big boy and Andre I'm yeezus like Kanye
I’m pisuperious your rapper rampaa
Mos Def like Dante my rhymes can't be repeated
So call me style Beyonce
You catch it I’m ready
MC’c needs to get stepping
In fact I’m here to teach rappers a lesson
Peace to brother question
Black fathers on carter so I’m darker than
The resident in your road spill
Stray happy my mother is Jack k
A ghetto classic
Peace to hurricane wonder classic
Might make you head flip like lady gymnastics to
The wall like spider man
I’m lighter man than the other man
Hey dash I’m your brother man
That's how we free style
Until 3am do it again and
Go tell a friend and so on and so on

When I rock it's like a deja vu
Revolution Fela Ku
When I grab this mic device and flip on all these  crews
I'm down for writers, breakers, movers and shakers
Illuminators
Somebody save us and take us to God who made us, blaow
Lick a shot, this is hip-hop
If I move to the east it still won't cease
So yo I don't stop
You get dropped by sonic waves
Caught in the maze ancient days
Heart of a lion, fire ablaze cause

No time, so close
But it seems that there's just one blood
That's why, don't go
It's the one thing you can't think of

They were doin' experiments on MCs
So I broke out, and I came like this, yo

Aooowe, uh, coming back
He's coming back, he's coming back
Aooowe!
He's coming back, he's coming back now

Bed's too big without you
Cold wind blows right through that open door
I can't sleep with ch'your memories, no, no
Dreaming dreams of what used to be
When she left I was cold inside
That look on my face was just pride
No regrets, no love, no tears
Livin' on my own, was the least of my fears

Now the bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big... without youooaoo
Aooowe

Since that day, that you dawn
Just had to carry on, yeah, yeah
Get through the day, but late at night
I went to my pillow, but it didn't feel right (haha)
Everyday's just the same
Or who's for the same again?
All I get was heart ache
All I made, was one mistake

Now the bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big... without youoooaoooo
Without youooaoo, without youooaoo
Without youooaoo, without youooaoo

Yo, ah, yo, yo check it out
Yo this heart ache bloody murda
Some to levels I never heard'a
""What's love got to do with it?"", the words of tina turn'a
Echo in my brain, late at night when I'm asleep
But the pain that I feel inside, is so deep
Plus this question, ""why did adam forsake his vow?""
Is a past in the future, with paradise in the now?
Yow, my bed is too big, it's queen size
Plus my queen disappeared, vanished before my eyes
Like an apparition, so now I'm caught up in the haytrix
Reconfigure my plot, I'm back to the basics
Replace her? never, no girl is on the level
I'm doing my best, so I don't dance with these devils
Plus KRS-One said ""that love's gonna get cha
Love's gonna getcha, love's gonna getcha,"" got me!
Bullet-proof soul, but then she shot me

We winning, spinning, grinning
Oh yes can’t tell it’s nothing
It’s so magnificent like Sunday
They say man makes money
Money never made the man
But, God made the woman so maybe I understand
That he needs grands in his hands

There’s so much I cheat from you now
You’re standing too close to me now
What am I supposed to do
Back from Polaris, to Paris, to Northern Lights
Real life is what you make it
So let’s make something fly
Get up on it when I saw your page grew 7 sonnets
Your method is too bionic
It’s driving me super sonic
Like back in the day when a baby boy
Had a microphone, a boom box, no toys
Break them kicks got time to shine
Pick em up in a pan and rope em up like it’s fine
Like a to the b to the c to the d e f r e s fresh I geuss

I'm still a little kid

I wake up in my crib

Nothing is heavy

To the blackwater

Phenomenon, trying to keep my dreams on
You can do your dance on
Now that you got your drink on
Ain't no thing
In my game
Baby hold on
Told you once before
More than love song

I can you be your Houdini
And bring you magic
I think whats happening
Here is tragic
Just let me through the door
Let beat your habits

Singing songs until we are dead and gone

C'mon c'mon let's slip out tonight
To the blackwater

Oil that is.. black gold
Uh uh
I'm price is the water
The fish diggy black black
They slaughter inside the order
And care take that back back
Black purge in the sky flying black facts
I feel like a fireman
I wanna swing axe axe
They let go Wall Street
Gordon Gecko
From the get-go
They escrow echoes
Shooting electrodes
Magnetics and weed
Angels like techno

Leave me out here, hang me out to dry (out to dry)

And in this game of destiny, every man is asking ""why?""
Or how they want to govern me

And in my deepest, darkest side
He was there to ease the pain
So i give up all my pie, just to glorify his name

Tell me ""how did you get so low?"" (so low)
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
Don't forget that you know who you are...

Roamin' the streets in the mecca
I don't suck and jive and I don't dilly-dally
I keep the crowd hyped and packed like Don Valley
I rally with the emcee on the corner
But I'ma warn ya, I've got rhymes till the mornin'
Son, I used to push a Land Rover
Now I push a pen to the pad, the dream is over
Stop biting 'cause it's inciting
Need to send blows of flows and beat riding
The most spectacular vernacular actor
That y'all, bringing stature, combat your ego
But even that is a battle
So hard to keep my motives pure and not metal
Rebels without a cause, break laws
But I'd rather break food over the beat for the applause
Tours, I get 'em, holes in the game, I knit 'em
I wonder whatever happened to Sally in the valley
Hmm, it seems she's all grown up
Time to head to Miskoky
'Cause the game's sewn up
I've been tryin' to learn this new song
But I hear the same ol' music every day

Gonna fly with her to the Yukon
Gonna melt my soul on ice, then get away
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yo people, here I am, here I am, what?
Laid back in the cut, tryin' to construct
A stone house with an invisible mirror
So I could take a look at myself a bit clearer
Seen, if you don't get it then don't cram
Observe that you do, then you can understand
I was walkin' down the street when I met this girl
Who said she was in love with diamonds and pearls
Shiny new rides, plush leather seats
Baby, don't you know you're just reacting to the streets?
Be acting like a freak 'cause your daddy left home
Now you wanna rock in a man with his own
Bangs, girl, get off the bling-bling
Train is turnin' our people into insane
Feigns for cellular phones and blue jeans
Why? Because they want a piece of the pie
My abilita familifa, a quicker mind
'Cause I need to proceed, deep with a Godspeed
Envy, whack emcees, get the gong
K-dub lookin' above with new songs
I've been tryin' to learn this new song

Hey, hey, hey
Gonna fly with her to the Yukon
Gonna melt my soul on ice, then get away

All that I've been shown is there's only you and me

And you gave me joy that took away the pain
And now your saying you're not so really sure
But you've heard these words so many times before
We can be down, for forever and ever and a day
I won't play around
Love you for always
Cuz I feel you!
All I think, is your love that's real
You know I take you there
Yeah, what
You know I
You know I take you there
So I said my love for you is not for sale
Cuz to them love is nothing but a game
I remember I thought I'd never find
Someone true enough to elevate my mind
So we can be down forever and ever and a day
I won't play around
Love for always
(Cuz I feel you baby)
All I feel is love that's real
Baby release your head
Cuz I can take you there
You know I.. what..
You know I can take you there
You know I What?
Come on I..
You know I take you there
You know I, what..?
Ah

Check it
Yo
Let me ignite the whole fight
Baby, I get slab when the spot get blown
Yo, my seed was sown
When I met you, you was bouncing hard
Word to god
Let any of these niggas knows, no nigga can pull your card
Check it
How many times you gotta be diss another fella
Cuz He tried to play you rather chill, accpaella
But i'm smart enough a hoe
When I see it
And baby girl I check your flow
You never be it
It's plain to see
You're not the same to me
So we manifest love to the same degree
No more wonder the way I am when I'm
Kickin' it with my
Some rows be all good some be all..
But, I'm metaphysical
Spiritual individual
Critical with residuals
Loving you was difficult
But I.. wanna take you there
Forever like a hip hop song
Baby, tougher than leather
Forever ever and a day
I won't play around
Love for you for always",https://genius.com/K-os-take-you-there-lyrics
Rise Like The Sun (The Dawn),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(all original rude boys know what do I
So heed warning as I stand before you without sorrow
Driven eternally by the immortality of blackness
Which leaves me confused when gangstas die today
The sun will still rise tommorrow)
Aiyo, pain stains my brain, I go insane
At times I wonder if I even know my name
Or who I be, who I perceive to be me
In a world where the fake get payed fully
You can't fool me, if you can't cycle the greenbacks
I mean that, so just chill with your feedback
And all, all that talk about billboard charts
Number one hits with no heart
Now where as a kite gets you high like the rising sun
I be breakin' brothers down and suprising 'em
With my lyrical prophocies, no one's stopping me
Cause I magnify words to high velocity
Sing this, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
(Chorus)
I rise like the sun sometimes, but then I fall
And like a black moon I rise when the night falls
And when the night falls, the mic illuminates
And it's the ultra-violet rays that keep me rising on my mission
I take a penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your desire
I got the vocab to set the world on fire
Now I remember laying back as a youth
Just looking at the sun, wondering about the truth
And how it's supposed to be
And how at times if the music felt close to me
Rocking spots since the age of sixteeen
You know what I mean, as I grab the microphone
Come correct and hit the scene
So let it fly baby, let if fly baby
I got the vocal canibus to get you high baby
You know these brothers rock the spot when it's all said and done
Definetly represent because we rise like the sun
(Chorus)
I'll save the vanity for your man and expanded to global spaces
You can see the cold heart looks on their faces
It's all a plan to exterminate the truest
Kos meditate like a microphone buddhist
Now, I'm not a teacher
Just trying to reach ya
I'll make you recognize
The sun will always rise
And even when the night falls, the moon illuminates brilliantly
It's all resellient, see
Sometimes I think about this world that we live in
And get fed up, and yo I think I want to give in
But it's the ultra-violet rays
Saving days
And stimulates my melonance
To eloquance
(Chorus)",https://genius.com/K-os-rise-like-the-sun-the-dawn-lyrics

I've been sleeping with fishes
She's been doing the dishes
Surfs up on the oil spill
There's a black pad now on the water
I've been inside of dreams on the seaside
Your friend is the enemy
Nothing is heavy

C'mon c'mon let's slip out tonight
To the blackwater

Phenomenon, trying to keep my dreams on
You can do your dance on
Now that you got your drink on
Ain't no thing
In my game
Baby hold on
Told you once before
More than love song

I can you be your Houdini
And bring you magic
I think whats happening
Here is tragic
Just let me through the door
Let beat your habits

Singing songs until we are dead and gone

C'mon c'mon let's slip out tonight
To the blackwater

Oil that is.. black gold
Uh uh
I'm price is the water
The fish diggy black black
They slaughter inside the order
And care take that back back
Black purge in the sky flying black facts
I feel like a fireman
I wanna swing axe axe
They let go Wall Street
Gordon Gecko
From the get-go
They escrow echoes
Shooting electrodes

Hit that old school lyrics yo

Like it at the bar like it I'm a lover at large
En garden
Begging your pardon
Harden, scorchin'
Always ringing the bells
I never barge in
I'm easy
Greasy rockin' chicks
Keep me dizzy
I'm busy with socks with tizzy
We hail from T-drizzy
It's K, Canada
I'm manager
I'm amateur
Damage your RAM
With my planet's sublaminal stamina
Go red to black
Respect
Rock it I'm getting down
Rocking the cold sound
Joni Mitchell and peeling out
Break it down
I'm wit it
I admit it
I going to get it
I'm about to hit it
Ask if I did it
Rise the depths
Hit the steps
Took away my breath
Quiet as kept
Please respect the architect
When I blast
I'm nasty
I'm down so fasty
And with my marijuana
Homie's so everlasting

All alone
Floating out here
Me and the microphone
In the atmosphere
Who's on the throne
And are you the coming down here?

And home alone

I don't mean to provoke your calm
You a hater now
Cuz I wrote this song
The rope is on you now
I'm searching for redemption
I'm running through the Shawshank with a hopeful poem
Hands full of em
Back the earth
Cats we keep peeling em
To run away no joke man
Its my fault your heart
Crush like a coke can
Hah, I should have been there for ya
But I'm with the satellites
So, talk to my lawyer
Yeah, I swear it would be different
I thought we could be the best of friend
In the end

The Lonely Ones,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Here's the thing
I don't trust this chick
We need you around, and she is just using you
Everyone just relax alright!
If there's one thing Ron Burgundy knows, it's women!
Ron
There are literally thousands of men
I should be with instead
But I am 72% sure that I love you...""

The lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who call in the nighttime
Lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who fall in love

Yo
Put back the mic in the holster
Picked up my drink from the coaster
And took a sip to the head
That's when GOD, read my mind
And sent an angel cherub
From behind, she said
I came to rescue you
Not to seduce you
This world is destitute
There's a few true
I'm one
You're like the sun I'm like the moon
Let's pretend where in the movie Blue Lagoon
Swoon! And then she kissed me
In the warm summer breeze
The one that'd melt my heart and Mr. Freeze
I couldn't believe
I couldn't conceive
A true love
When doves cry butterfly
With bullet wings
I tried to sing
But not a note came out
No doubt
This could be the end of my vow
To love music over all
My pledge to never fall
Cuz a man is like a baby when he crawls
Y'all

The lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who call in the night time
Lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who fall in love

One year passed
And on a summer night
We were looking out the window
With the city lights
I hopped a cab downtown
So I could hear the sounds of the
Solitary people on the street
She stayed at home
I'm not a man that's unfaithful
But then again
I'm not a man who's un-fateful
When destiny is on the table
I eat from the plate
That's when I heard a voice that
Made the earth rotate
She said
I came to rescue you
Not to seduce you
This world is destitute
There's a few true
I'm one
You're like the sun I'm like the moon
Let's pretend you're not in love with sonnet
Oooo!
She tried to kiss me but I walked away
Went back to my planet and called it another day
Call it another way of being in love
Or call it being afraid of being lonely
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love with me",https://genius.com/K-os-the-lonely-ones-lyrics

A szavakat fonja

Alig hallható

SheClipse,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""This is a tough decision
So much to think about
Basically the biggest story of my career
Launching me to a level i've never known before
Or saving the woman i used to have familiar relations with
This is hard
Come on!
It's me poppa burgundy alright
Let the games begin
There he is
There he is
I'm very aroused""

Uh
Ok
Ok i get it
Check it out
Self esteem don't approve of the cream
Thats why i can had to throw the verse in the latrine
The bathroom and the chicks in the toilet seat
I don't sip coke when i'm on a magazine
On a cover of another mega team dream team
Alien crystal clean
Yo don't procrastinate
Just eradicate
The fate the judge you hate
From the gate
I'm biologically engineered to treat the speaker
All of no fear
Throw your fan of the man
And your hands in the air
While you think of a thought to be clear

Oh!
So if you think your a star
So girl come out tonight
If you stay at home in the dark
You'll just lose your sight
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes out
Everybody loves the sun
When the sun comes out
You living like a lick a shot
I'm not a have i'm not a have not
I'm more like astronaut
More like Metallica hip hop
Microphone mascot
Living int he dark
Tin man searching for a heart
Looking for the wizard of oz
If everybody up in here is a star
Then who's planet earth for the cause yo
Dozey do
Mosy-fo
To blow up the whole freak show and go
Back to the drawing board
I don't know why stay america rap when she's never home
But wait i think i hear a knock at the door
Think about the freak on the floor
Or
16 12 24
Can't pretend i'm in not in love anymore

Oh!
So if you think your a star
So girl come out tonight
If you stay at home in the dark
You'll just lose you sight

You wore all the jewels
Only Nature coult think of
Girl in the café
You really pushed me to the brink of pain
To see such beauty
A pair of eyes just like a flash of light
I lost you
But I defrost you
From my memory´s freezer
Every night
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´m still missing you
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´ve still got no clue about you
Girl in the café
All those tears are drying
I´m not denying
Girl in the café
The magic´s gone
And there´s no more crying
For you and your ivory skin
With Sister Midnight gasping within
All the icons
The zodiac signs
Have failed to help you
To get me to sin
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´m still missing you
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´ve still got no clue about you
Girl in the café
Inside of me a bomb exploded
My heart was loaded
Girl in the café
You conquered me
And I want you to know it
A war was waging in me
To last awhile
Centuries maybe
Or else
I might forget
Your eyes that were
Glowing so sad
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´m still missing you
No you weren´t the love of my life
And I´ve still got no clue all about you",https://genius.com/K-os-girl-in-the-cafe-lyrics

Pedig nem vehetem le rólad a szemem
Lepedõm markolja sóhajod:
Csak Te mondod így ki a nevem

Hogy szádban hozd el éltetõ vizemet
Itt vagy velem, ahogy írom ezt a sort
Ahogy szemedhez ér, én ott vagyok Veled!

Onnan is visszahív egy szó
Dalt szül a súlyos félhomály
Érzem, hogy sírni volna most jó
Reszket a föld, ha hozzám ér
Egy-egy békés gondolat
Amit nekem küldesz el
Amiben magad is benne vagy…

I was down my dreams were wearing thin
When you're lost where do you begin
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way
Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look and then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be
CHORUS
Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight
Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back how did I exist
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are
CHORUS
Tonight I fell in love with you
And all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow
Baby, love is here and now there's

Rising like the sun in the highest noon
I don't want to lose the ability
Look at how they coming and they hang me high
Leave me out here, hang me out to dry
Standing on the side like some parasites
Waiting on their turn to eat
And in this game of destiny
Every man is asking, ""Why?""
Or how they want to govern me
I couldn't let them if they tried
And in my deepest, darkest side
He was there to ease the pain
So I give up all my pie
Just to glorify his name
Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are
Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are
And it doesn't last
When you turn the sand into glass
They can steal the sun, out of the sky
Reach for a star, never too high
Don't shoot me down
Not that you would
And don't pass me by
I'm not your fool
Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go

Nein verdammt, man muss nur paar YouTube-Kommentare lesen
Du suchst doch immer in deinen Texten einen Sinn
Doch es ändert nichts, außer dass du tief in Selbstmitleid versinkst
Deine aktuelle Statusmeldung?
Für dich heißt es C'est la vie wenn ich dir und deiner digitalen Welt den Stecker zieh'
Sie reden von einem Leben zwischen Huren und Cash
Doch drehen nur Runden in ihrem Zimmer Bruder - Stubenarrest

Mióta megszületett, mert rossz lóra tett
Én szerencsés vagyok, mert küzdhetek
Csak a harc, csak az éri meg

Ölelj meg újra,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ha karomba zárlak
Téged
A szabadág ölel
A világ csak rángat
Engem
A karod ringat el
Ha mézedbe olvadok
Nem tudom, hol vagyok
Minden dolgom várhat
Lehet a neved
Öröm vagy bánat
Én otthon vagyok nálad
Ölelj meg újra
Ölelj meg ugyanúgy
Még egyszer
Csak az a múltad
Amire velem együtt
Emlékszel
Ha fáradtan ébredsz
Nekem
Ugyanannyira tetszel
Nem a szépség szobra vagy
Hanem
Egy igazi ember
Éjek és nappalok
Ördögök, angyalok
Minden elmúlik egyszer
Rövid az élet
Ha gyorsítva éled
Hát hosszabbítsd meg egy perccel
Ölelj meg újra
Ölelj meg ugyanúgy
Még egyszer
Csak az a múltad
Amire velem együtt
Emlékszel",https://genius.com/K-os-olelj-meg-ujra-lyrics
Beavatás,Beavatás,UnKnown,"Megratlan knyv vagyok

Hymns for disco,UnKnown,2019.0,"Black Ice - Hymn For Disco
K-os
Sometimes the way we look at life can be too serious
'Cause we're dancing by the pale moonlight
I wake up in the morning and I feel delirious
'Cause there's something that I did last night
But then the angel came off with me
She said that life was more than you see
You've got to be the change that should be
So don't die, just fly
We're just some fools with the lights on
Hope you'll be coming soon and turning up the mood
After you prove that the night's over
When are you coming back to save this heart of mine, yeah?
Time to take it slow, black ice, white snow
What if the truth is, we don't really know?
If so, then life is a mystery
This could be the end of all history
But wait, the sun rises in the east
And the world still spins 360 degrees on it's axis
This…",https://genius.com/K-os-hymns-for-disco-lyrics
Be lettél oltva,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hiába rejted
Hiába õrzöd
A titkod nem titok már
A titkod az ördög
És keresi a külföld
És keresik helyben
De az ördög bent lakik
Egy ostoba fejben
És elmenekülnél
Innen a Holdra
Csak mert szeretet ellen
Be lettél oltva
Tudom, hogy Neked is
Rém kellemetlen
Hogy be lettél oltva
Szeretet ellen
Pont ez a baj Veled:
Van eszed, de nem él a szíved
Nem vagy ugyan beteg
De a bogyókat szeded
Az emberek utálják
Amit nem értenek
Ravaszkodnod, látod
Nem érte meg
És elmenekülnél
Innen a Holdra
Csak mert szeretet ellen
Be lettél oltva
Tudom, hogy Neked is
Rém kellemetlen
Hogy be lettél oltva
Szeretet ellen
Ez nem én vagyok
Ez nem mi vagyunk
Így aztán mindegy
Hogy áldás vagy átok
Hogy torzan látják a nagyvilágot
Egyes újságokba író srácok
Nekem sok a dolgom
Én nem érek rá
Így hát mindegy
Hogy mit is szóltál
De csak akkor ítélj
Hogy én ki vagyok
Ha egyszer tudni fogod
Hogy Te kicsoda voltál
És elmenekülnél
Innen a Holdra
Csak mert szeretet ellen
Be lettél oltva
Tudom, hogy Neked is
Rém kellemetlen
Hogy be lettél oltva
Szeretet ellen",https://genius.com/K-os-be-lettel-oltva-lyrics

Ismerj fel,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hideg a reggel
Százezer ember
Lehajtott fejjel
Most is hosszú útra kel
Hiába érzem
Hogy ma köztük vagy éppen
Az arcokat nézem
Hogy különbözni melyik mer
Ismerj Fel
A város a szemedbe nevet
Az ég alatt nincsen ma helyed
Most egyedül én tudom a neved
Ma találkoznunk kell
Ismerj fel
A város a szemedbe nevet
Az ég alatt nincsen ma helyed
Most egyedül én tudom a neved
Ma találkoznunk kell
Ismerj fel
Tüzes a nappal
Tétova angyal
Megolvadt szárnyad
Többé nem repíthet el
A város a szemedbe nevet
Az ég alatt nincsen ma helyed
Most egyedül én tudom a neved
Ma találkoznunk kell
Ismerj fel
